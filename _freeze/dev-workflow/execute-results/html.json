Each simulation model can be seen as a small research *software project*, and the modeller as its *developer*.\nThinking like a software developer helps to ensure that the model is:\n\n* **Reproducible:** anyone (including your future self) can run it and obtain the same results.\n* **Transparent:** the model’s assumptions, mechanisms, and implementation are easy to inspect.\n* **Collaborative:** colleagues can contribute, review, or reuse your code and data.\n* **Extensible:** improvements, corrections, or new experiments can be added without breaking the project.\n* **Reusable:** others can build on your work.\n\nWe can recast the generic modelling steps into a software development workflow represented as:\n\n1. **Conceptual model:** Defines the system, processes, and hypotheses. Identify inputs (data), outputs, and validation criteria.  \n2. **Implementation or \"implemented model\":** Translate the conceptual model into executable code (e.g., in NetLogo). Expanded through \"coding sessions\".  \n4. **Version control:** After each coding session, commit your changes with Git (locally) and push them to a remote repository in GitHub. When working directly in the remote repository in your browser, you will need to commit changes to each file individually. When changing your model in NetLogo, you will have to open the `.nlogo` or `.nlogox` file in a text editor and copy-paste its contents into the remote version (not recommended).\n5. **Experimentation:** Run simulations manually in NetLogo, or systematic experiments using NetLogo’s *BehaviorSpace* or custom procedures in NetLogo, external files (e.g., datasets generated in R), or executing NetLogo from R.  \n6. **Analysis:** Process and visualise simulation outputs in R, write up results.  \n7. **Publication**: publish and share your complete project repository, including analysis outputs (specific outputs can be used for an article).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"grViz html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-4f0afbe1b84767b591be\" style=\"width:100%;height:464px;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-4f0afbe1b84767b591be\">{\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\ndigraph dev_workflow {\\n\\ngraph [layout = dot, rankdir = TB, overlap = false]\\n\\nnode [shape = box]\\nA [label = \\\"💡 Conceptualise\\\"]\\nB [label = \\\"📝 Design\\\"]\\nC [label = \\\"🧱 Programme\\\"]\\nD [label = \\\"🔄 Commit changes\\\"]\\nE [label = \\\"🧪 Experiment/simulate\\\"]\\nF [label = \\\"📊 Analyse\\\"]\\nG [label = \\\"📢 Publish\\\"]\\n\\nA -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> G\\n}\",\"config\":{\"engine\":\"dot\",\"options\":null}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn practice, these stages overlap and repeat. Conceptual choices affect implementation; analysis reveals bugs or design flaws; revisions are documented in version control.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"grViz html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-6fe158d3c085caeb1883\" style=\"width:100%;height:464px;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-6fe158d3c085caeb1883\">{\"x\":{\"diagram\":\"\\ndigraph dev_workflow {\\n\\ngraph [layout = dot, rankdir = TB, overlap = false]\\n\\nnode [shape = box]\\nA [label = \\\"💡 Conceptualise\\\"]\\nB [label = \\\"📝 Design\\\"]\\nC [label = \\\"🧱 Programme\\\"]\\nD [label = \\\"🔄 Commit changes\\\"]\\nE [label = \\\"🧪 Experiment/simulate\\\"]\\nF [label = \\\"📊 Analyse\\\"]\\nG [label = \\\"📢 Publish\\\"]\\nH [label = \\\"🔁 Revise\\\", shape = circle]\\n\\nA -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> G\\nC -> H D -> H E -> H F -> H G -> H\\nH -> B H -> C H -> D H -> E H -> F H -> G\\n}\",\"config\":{\"engine\":\"dot\",\"options\":null}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe goal is *incremental improvement* rather than perfection at once. Treat this as a *living process*: your repository should tell the story of how your model evolved.\n\nIn practice, your workflow should go over these steps in time in a safe, but tentative way: \n\n```\n💡📝 First conceptual model with enough definitions (variables, parameters, agents, functions)\n        ↓\n🧱 First programming session creating a few model elements (not runnable)\n        ↓\n🔄 Commit changes: \"add netlogo file\"\n        ↓\n🔁📝 Rethinking a few definitions\n        ↓\n🧱 Second programming session updating the model with new definitions (not runnable)\n        ↓\n🔄 Commit changes: \"update netlogo file\"\n        ↓\n🧱 Third programming session creating a minimal set of procedures for initialisation (runnable)\n        ↓\n🔄 Commit changes: \"update netlogo file\"\n        ↓\n...\n        ↓\n🧪📊 Run a few simulations and observe the model dynamics (also output variables)\n        ↓\n🔁🧱 Refine a model procedure, not quite behaving as intended\n        ↓\n...\n        ↓\n...\n```\n\n---\n\n## Tools and services checklist\n\nTo follow best practices, every simulation modeller should maintain a working toolkit and a structured workflow environment.
