## Margins to improve and explore

There are many other points to refactor, explore alternatives and expand. Just remember to first give it a think and then start writing code.

For example:  
- Can we visualise `catchmentArea` of settlements in the NetLogo View, instead of `sizeLevel`?
- Could we find a way to calibrate the speed of traders to the same daily rhythm of the weather variables?  
- Could rivers also affect `patchCost`?
