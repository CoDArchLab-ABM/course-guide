# Sneak-peak at other languages {#program-other-languages}

You are now introduced to NetLogo. However, please remember that **agent-based modelling (ABM)** is not limited to this language and platform.
It is highly recommended that you learn and practice with other programming languages to experience how ABM models can be implemented in different ways, with different goals and trade-offs.

## 13.1 ABM beyond NetLogo

Potentially, any programming language can be used to implement an ABM model. After all, an ABM is “just code” describing the state and behaviour of multiple interacting agents over time. However, ABM modellers typically rely on specialised **frameworks** or **libraries** that provide ready-made functions for creating agents, scheduling their actions, managing environments, and recording outputs.

These frameworks help standardise model structure, improve reproducibility, and often support integration with data analysis or visualisation tools.

Below are some of the most relevant ABM platforms and libraries beyond NetLogo. Each of them offers different strengths and target audiences.

## 13.3 Other frameworks and resources

There are many more ABM frameworks across different domains and programming languages.
The **SWARM.org** community maintains an updated list of simulation platforms, including older but historically significant systems such as **Swarm**, **MASON**, and **NetLogo** itself.

## 13.4 What to take away

* **NetLogo** is ideal for learning ABM concepts quickly, focusing on model logic rather than low-level programming.
* **Other frameworks** (like Mesa, RePast, or Agents.jl) offer greater flexibility, scalability, and integration with scientific workflows — but they require more programming experience.
* Understanding multiple environments helps you:

  * Evaluate models written by others in different ecosystems.
  * Choose the right tool for your own future research.
  * Appreciate that ABM is not a “NetLogo thing” but a **modelling approach** applicable across disciplines.

## 💡 Optional exploration

If you’re curious, pick one of the above frameworks and browse its documentation.
Ask yourself:

* How are agents defined and scheduled?
* How is the simulation environment represented (grid, network, continuous space)?
* How are outputs collected and visualised?
  These are the same questions you will address in your own models, regardless of language.
