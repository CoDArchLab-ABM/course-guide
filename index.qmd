[Agent-based modelling for archaeologists. From concept to application and publication (14436.0398)](https://vvz.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/campus/all/event.asp?gguid=0xE2AAF8DAB10F4972B8854C6EDC49A4DD&from=&tabID=1&tguid=0x5980070F0C7A42899012ACFE7660AC4B&objgguid=NEW&lang=de)

**Time slot**: Monday, 10:00-11:30

**Place**: KÃ¼pperstift, Kerpener Str., 30, 2nd floor (125/02) [CoDArchLab](https://archaeologie.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/institut/fachgebiete/archaeoinformatik/codarchlab)

**Course instructor**: Andreas Angourakis

## **Course summary**

This course introduces the basic concepts and workflow of simulation and agent-based modelling (ABM), as used in archaeology.

More specifically, we will cover the prototyping of a conceptual model into a working simulation model, the 'refactoring' of code (cleaning, restructuring, optimizing), the re-use of published model parts and algorithms, the exploration of alternative designs, and the use of geographic, climatic and archaeological data to frame the model in a specific case study.

This tutorial uses [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/), a flexible well-established modelling platform known for its relatively low-level entry requirements in terms of programming experience. It has been particularly used in social sciences and ecology for research and educational purposes.

The course offers implementation examples of least path cost algorithms, hydrological and land productivity modelling, network dynamics, and cultural evolution. Additionally, we learn the basics of Git and GitHub for version control, which will help us organize, maintain, and share models and related materials.

## **Course schedule**

## **Evaluation**

Attendance and completion of small exercises, individually or as a group.
