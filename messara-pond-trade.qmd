# The MesaraTrade model {#messara-pond-trade}

Finally, after much of the modelling equivalent of *blood and sweat*, we reach the point where we can combine the contribution of all our modules with the full implementation of the Pond Trade model (step 13).

## Integrating module 4 (ARID) and 5 (routes)

We use module 4 - ARID as the starting template and add `import-routes-from-file` and all route related procedures. We should be able to import the routes data saved before and load it during set up, as the last step before `setup-patches`:

```NetLogo
globals
[
  ...

  routes

  ...
]

...

to setup

  clear-all

  ; --- loading/testing parameters -----------

  import-map-with-flows ; import-world must be the first step

  set-constants

  set-parameters

  import-routes-from-file

  ; --- core procedures ----------------------

  set currentYear weatherInputData_firstYear
  set currentDayOfYear 1

  ;;; values are taken from input data
  set-day-weather-from-input-data currentDayOfYear currentYear

  ask patchesWithElevationData [ update-WAT ]

  ; --- display & output handling ------------------------

  update-output
  
  refresh-view

  paint-routes

  ; -- time -------------------------------------

  reset-ticks

end

...

to refresh-view

  ...

  paint-routes
  paint-active-routes

end


to paint-routes

  ;;; define list of shades of red in NetLogo
  let redShades (list 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19)
  ;;; NOTE: this is needed because rgb colors based on elevation are a list
  ;;; while NetLogo color are numbers

  ; resets route patches to the terrain color
  foreach routes
  [ ?1 ->
    let aRoute ?1

    foreach aRoute
    [ ??1 ->
      ask ??1 [ display-elevation ]
    ]
  ]

  ; paint route patches in shades of red depending on route frequency
  foreach routes
  [ ?1 ->
    let aRoute ?1

    foreach aRoute
    [ ??1 ->
      ask ??1
      [
        if (showRoutes)
        [
          ifelse (not member? pcolor redShades) ; if its the first route crossing the patch
          [
            set pcolor 11
          ]
          [
            set pcolor min (list (pcolor + 1) (19)) ; sets a maximum at 19 (the brightest)
          ]
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]

end

to paint-active-routes

  ask traders
  [
    foreach route
    [ ?1 ->
      ask ?1
      [
        ifelse (showActiveRoutes)
        [
          set pcolor yellow
        ]
        [
          if (not showRoutes) ; if not displaying all routes
          [
            ; resets to the patch terrain color
            display-elevation
          ]
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]

end

```

## Integrating Pond Trade (step 13)

Next, we bring all the extra code and interface objects present in Pond Trade (step 13). Most procedures require no modifications. The exceptions are:

- There is no `isLand` variable here and, given that there is no water patches, we should simply erase the code that distinguishes it.
- Since there is only land patches and we are using the standard deviation of elevations to assign `pathCost`, there are no `relativePathCostInLand` or `relativePathCostInPort`. We can erase all reference to these two parameters, which will leave the corresponding cultural traits of transport technology as the sole modifiers of `pathCost`.

We carefully organise the scheduling of calls in `setup` and `go`:

```NetLogo
to setup

  clear-all
  reset-ticks

  ; set the random seed so we can reproduce the same experiment
  random-seed seed
  set patchesCount count patches

  create-map

  create-coastal-settlements

  set-routes

  create-traders-per-settlement

  update-output

  update-display

  update-plots

end

...

to go

  tick

  if (ticks = 10000 or count turtles > 500) [ stop ]

  update-traders

  update-settlements

  update-output

  update-display

end
```

## Extension: ARID as a factor of settlement productivity

Last, we need to connect ARID to settlement productivity.

We first calculate the value of two new settlement variables, `catchmentArea` and `ARIDinCatchmentArea`. The latter is the average ARID within the settlement catchment area. In turn, the catchment area is calculated using a gradient decay function, dependent on `sizeLevel` and two parameters, `catchmentSlope` and `catchmentRadiusMaximum`. This is a *very* preliminary solution, but will suffice for us to observe the dynamics of Pond Trade playing out over the Mesara Valley.

```NetLogo
settlements-own
[
  ...
  catchmentArea
  ARIDinCatchmentArea
]

...

to update-ARIDinCatchmentArea
  
  let patchesInCatchmentArea patches in-radius catchmentArea
  
  ifelse (count patchesInCatchmentArea = 1)
  [ set ARIDinCatchmentArea [ARID] of patch-here ]
  [ set ARIDinCatchmentArea mean [ARID] of patchesInCatchmentArea]
  
end

to update-catchmentArea
  
  set catchmentArea get-value-in-gradient sizeLevel catchmentSlope catchmentRadiusMaximum
  
end

to-report get-value-in-gradient [ input gradient maximum ]

  report e ^ ( - input / ((gradient / 100) * maximum) )

end
```

And *voilà*! We can now run our boosted Pond Trade model within the context of our case study.

## Debugging

But wait! You press the "go" button a few times and NetLogo accuse an error! Can you solve this problem? You will find the solution hidden as a couple of commented-out lines in `BlockC_module6_MesaraTrade.nlogo`.

## Margins to improve and explore

There are many other points to refactor, explore alternatives and expand. Just remember to first give it a think and then start writing code.

For example:  
- Can we visualise `catchmentArea` of settlements in the NetLogo View, instead of `sizeLevel`?
- Could we find a way to calibrate the speed of traders to the same daily rhythm of the weather variables?  
- Could rivers also affect `patchCost`?
