Unfortunately, academic publishing has become a saturated media, and it is relatively hard to be updated about specific types of research, such as ABM models, which are often spread in many kinds of publications. Public model repositories, such as [CoMSES](https://www.comses.net/) and initiatives like the modular library from [NASSA](https://archaeology-abm.github.io/NASSA-hub) may aid you greatly in this task. But, ultimately, finding a relevant model will depend on your skills in Internet search (including prompting the right LLM!) and the attention others have put to preparing and publishing their models.\n\nIn the following example, instead of building a model from scratch, we will be visiting the conceptual model corresponding to the **_Pond Trade_** model, designed by me in 2018 to facilitate learning ABM, mainly for archaeology and history.\n\nHaving started with a mechanism definition (the model), which already is declared to represent a phenomenon relevant to archaeologists (trade), we will then proceed to select a set of types of evidence and a case study to demonstrate it.\n\n## The Pond Trade context\n\nThe Pond Trade model represents mechanisms that link cultural integration and economic cycles caused by the exchange of materials (“trade”) between settlements placed in a heterogeneous space (“pond”). The Pond Trade design intentionally includes several aspects commonly used by other ABM models in archaeology and social sciences, such as multiple types of agents, the representation of a so-called “cultural vector”, procedural generation of data, network dynamics, and the reuse of published submodels and algorithms.\n\nThe Pond Trade model and all its versions were developed by myself, Andreas Angourakis, and are available for download in [this repository](https://codarchlab-abm.github.io/course-guide/assets/netlogo/) and its [original repository](https://github.com/Andros-Spica/PondTrade).\n\nA similar model, TravellerSim, was presented by Graham and Steiner [-@graham_travellersim_2008], who were revisiting an older non-ABM model [@rihll_modelling_1991, pp. 59-95], even though one was not based on the other. All three, and indeed many more, coincide in the \"informal formulation\" of the core mechanism, rooted in economic theory, relating the size of settlements to how they are interconnected. \n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n\nSuch a situation, where similar mechanisms are modelled from scratch several times by different researchers, is, in fact, prevalent in the ABM community. There is a growing number of publications and models spreading over many specialised circles, which do not always cover all details about model implementation. Meanwhile, there is still no adequate logistical support for orderly sharing and searching for models across disciplines, despite the efforts made by CoMSES. The primary mission of NASSA is to offer a long-term solution to this problem.\n\n:::\n\n## Phenomenon\n\nThe Pond Trade model core idea is inspired by the premise that the settlement economy's size depends on the volume of materials exchanged between settlements for economic reasons (i.e. ‘trade’). The \"economic\" size of settlements is an overall measure of, for example, population size, the volume of material production, built-up surface, etc. The guiding suggestion was that economy size displays a chaotic behaviour as described in chaos theory: describing apparently \"random\" oscillations as an emergent of deterministic mechanisms. The cause of this chaotic behaviour would be presumably the shifting nature of trade routes as the outcome of many context-dependent decision-making processes. Furthermore, in addition to variation in time, routes would be bounded to more stable constraints in space, explicitly concerning the contrast of land in front of maritime and fluvial routes.\n\n## Mechanism: a first approach\n\nThe initial inspiration for a model design may be theoretically profound, empirically based, or well-connected to discussions in the academic literature. However, the primary core mechanism of a model must narrow down to a straightforward, intelligible process. In this case, the focus is to represent a positive feedback loop between settlement size and the trade volumes coming in and out, which can be described as follows:\n\n**Core mechanism**:  \n- Traders choose their destination trying to maximize the value of their cargo by considering settlement size and distance from their base settlement;  \n- An active trade route will increase the economic size of settlements at both ends  \n- An increase in size will increase trade by: \n  - Making a settlement more attractive to traders from other settlements  \n  - Allowing the settlement to host more traders.\n- An active trade route will increase the cultural similarity between two settlements through the movement of traders and goods from one settlement to the other (cultural transmission)  \n\n**Elements** (potentially entities):  \n- settlements  \n- traders  \n- terrain  \n- routes  \n- goods  \n\n**Preliminary rules**:   \n- Coastal settlements of variable size around a rounded water body (“pond”)  \n- Traders travel between the settlements  \n- Traders travel faster or slower depending on the terrain\n- Once in their base settlement, traders evaluate all possible trips and choose the one with the greater cost-benefit ratio  \n- Traders carry economic value and cultural traits between the base and destination settlements\n- Settlement size depends on the economic value received from trading\n- The economic value produced in a settlement depends on its size\n- The number of traders per settlement depends on its size\n\n**Targeted dynamics**:  \nSettlements that become trade hubs will increase in size and have a greater cultural influence over their trade partners, though also receiving much of their aggregated influences\n\nThe display above might seem somewhat chaotic and vague, but it intends to represent one of the best-case scenarios in terms of the conciseness of the initial conceptual model. There are no golden rules, good-for-all schemes or \"right words\" at this stage. You should start from your (or your team's) knowledge and hypotheses and move these into implementation, where you may revise them. In my opinion, you should not limit your ideas beforehand to external frameworks (*e.g.*, some of the points required in the ODD).\n\nStill, we count here on the second layer of the conceptual model, which allows us to have an overall plan of the implementation steps.   \n\n## Base terrain\n\nThe Pond Trade model requires a \"geography\" of discrete spatial units. For simplicity, we define two types of spatial units, **land** and **water**. The general configuration should form a main water body, the \"pond\", surrounded by land, and settlements should be placed around this water body. This gives us the context for having a differential cost in travelling between settlements (assuming that travel over water is easier/faster), and allows us to work with the concept of *route* in an heterogeneous terrain.\n\n## First-tier dynamics\n\nTo pace the complexity of modelling process, we organise the further development of the Pond Trade conceptual model in two tiers. The first tier will aim to cover only some aspects of our initial formulation:\n\n*Mechanisms*:\n- ↑ global level of productivity → ↑ settlement production  \n- ↑ number of settlements → ↓ distance between settlements\n- ↑ settlement size → ↑ settlement production → ↑ trade flow from/to settlement → ↑ settlement size  \n- ↑ settlement size → ↑ number of traders based in settlement → ↑ trade flow from/to settlement → ↑ settlement size  \n- ↑ trade attractiveness of route A to B → ↑ trade flow A to B  \n- ↑ distance A to B → ↓ trade attractiveness A to B\n- ↑ size B → ↑trade attractiveness A to B\n- ↑ trade flow A to B → ↑ trade flow B to A  \n\n![Pond Trade conceptual model at start (first tier)](assets/images/0_conceptAtStart_firstTier.png)  \n*Pond Trade conceptual model at start (first tier)*\n\nTrack the paths made by the arrows in our diagram. Notice that we have drawn a system with at least two positive feedback loops (cycles with \"+\" arrows), one mediated by the production and the other by the number of traders.\n\n*Expected dynamics*: differentiation of settlements (size) according to their relative position  \n\n## Second-tier dynamics\n\nTo reach the full version of the Pond Trade model, we also need to address the aspects related to cultural transmission and evolution:\n\n*Mechanisms*:  \n\n- ↑ global undirected variation in culture → ↑ or ↓ cultural similarity A and B (cultural drift)  \n- ↑ trade flow A to B → ↑ cultural similarity A and B (cultural integration)  \n- ↑ global cultural permeability → ↑ cultural similarity A and B, if A and B are trading (acceleration of cultural integration)  \n\n![Pond Trade conceptual model at start (second tier)](assets/images/0_conceptAtStart_secondTier.png)  \n*Pond Trade conceptual model at start (second tier)*\n\n*Expected dynamics*: cultural integration as the outcome of exchange network dynamics  \n\n## Conclusion\n\nOnce a minimum conceptual model is defined, we should use caution when attempting our first implementation. A relatively simple model may still correspond to code that can be very difficult to control and understand. Simulation models are very sensitive to the presence of feedback loops. You will notice later in the step-wise implementation of the Pond Trade model, that the positive feedback loops present in the conceptual model are not included until the most basic and predictable aspects are properly defined and their isolated behaviours
