            "abstract": "\"\"Growing Artificial Societies\" is a milestone in social science research. It vividly demonstrates the potential of agent-based computer simulation to break disciplinary boundaries. It does this by analyzing in a unified framework the dynamic interactions of such diverse activities as trade, combat, mating, culture, and disease. It is an impressive achievement.\" – Robert Axelrod, University of Michigan How do social structures and group behaviors arise from the interaction of individuals? \"Growing Artificial Societies\" approaches this question with cutting-edge computer simulation techniques. Fundamental collective behaviors such as group formation, cultural transmission, combat, and trade are seen to \"emerge\" from the interaction of individual agents following a few simple rules. In their program, named Sugarscape, Epstein and Axtell begin the development of a \"bottom up\" social science that is capturing the attention of researchers and commentators alike. The study is part of the 2050 Project, a joint venture of the Santa Fe Institute, the World Resources Institute, and the Brookings Institution. The project is an international effort to identify conditions for a sustainable global system in the next century and to design policies to help achieve such a system. \"Growing Artificial Societies\" is also available on CD-ROM, which includes about 50 animations that develop the scenarios described in the text. \"Copublished with the Brookings Institution\"",

            "abstract": "This article presents an agent-based model designed to explore the development of cooperation in hunter-fisher-gatherer societies that face a dilemma of sharing an unpredictable resource that is randomly distributed in space. The model is a stylised abstraction of the Yamana society, which inhabited the channels and islands of the southernmost part of Tierra del Fuego (Argentina-Chile). According to ethnographic sources, the Yamana developed cooperative behaviour supported by an indirect reciprocity mechanism: whenever someone found an extraordinary confluence of resources, such as a beached whale, they would use smoke signals to announce their find, bringing people together to share food and exchange different types of social capital. The model provides insight on how the spatial concentration of beachings and agents’ movements in the space can influence cooperation. We conclude that the emergence of informal and dynamic communities that operate as a vigilance network preserves cooperation and makes defection very costly.",

            "abstract": "Archaeologists and other scholars interested in the past have begun to explore issues in ancient societies by incorporating new computer simulation techniques in their research. Among the popular approaches, agent-based methodologies are commonly used to answer questions involving the interactions of natural and social systems. Building upon such efforts, a new object-oriented simulation framework is being developed for ancient Mesopotamia that can assemble and execute highly complex simulation scenarios. This framework can be used to investigate socioecological interactions over a broad range of social, spatial, and temporal scales, allowing for a wide range of past socioecological issues to be concurrently addressed. Such capabilities are enabled by simulation tools that are flexible, scalable, and highly expressive. Perhaps the greatest promise of these tools for studying the past is their potential for enabling scholars to gain new insights by testing various theoretical hypotheses and perspectives in social-natural systems in a rich socioecological simulation context.",

            "abstract": "Agent-based models (ABMs), perhaps used along with other methods, are increasingly being applied to address problems involving social-ecological systems (SES). However, systematic and standardized techniques for organizing data requirements and collecting information for such models are generally not applied. Defining the types of data that need to be collected is a critical step in instantiating relevant models and detailing behavioral patterns. By organizing data needs into pertinent categories, researchers can focus efforts to make data collection more efficient, provide a clear record of gathered data, conserve project resources, and create models more easily. In this paper, we present a formal method, which we call Delineate, Structure, and Gather (DSG), that has been applied to guide the determination of data requirements, structure data needs, and enable data collection for the development of ABMs addressing SES. The presented framework continues and supplements existing efforts that provide standardization and protocol techniques for constructing ABMs. An active project is presented in order to demonstrate how DSG can be implemented to address SES issues.",

            "abstract": "The genocide in Darfur, Sudan is the first major humanitarian crisis of the 21st century. Over 2 million people have been displaced and tens of thousands have been killed. Popular explanations of the conflict root it in racism and prejudice orchestrated by the Sudanese government and abetted by the world community’s negligence. While the complicity of the Sudanese government is evident, a closer analysis of the sequence of events suggests that the crisis is rooted in local conflicts over material resources brought about by an ecological crisis. Standard social theory has proven inadequate for analyzing the grass roots nature of the Darfur crisis. We have developed a flexible agent-based computer simulation of pastoral nomad/sedentary peasant interaction (NOMAD) that can be adapted to particular environmental and social settings. Our focus on how environmental and material factors condition individual agent response allows us to model how collective behaviors (mass raiding, genocide) can emerge from individual motives and needs. Many factors influence the conflict in Darfur (ethnicity, global politics, Sudanese politics). However, our simulations reinforce the analyses of some social scientists that argue the Darfur crisis is the inevitable result of the breakdown of land use in the face of growing populations, marginal habitats, and an unprecedented ecological crisis.

            "abstract": "In Sahel, land and resources are used, according to the seasons, by various actors with interests sometimes difficult to conciliate. This spatial competition for the access to the natural resources induces a set of processes leading to overgrazing and conflicts for the access to water. In such a complex agro-sylvo-pastoral context, acquiring and formalizing knowledge about the practices and rules which govern the system are essential to help and accompany the rural populations towards the sustainable management of their environment. Among the new modelling tools coming from the field of Artificial Intelligence, Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are now widely used to tackle the issue of integrated natural resource management. The increase in popularity of ABMs is partially due to their intelligibility, not only by scientists from various research fields, but also by stakeholders. It then becomes easier to build an understandable representation of the system as an “artificial world” and to perform simulations in order to collectively test and discuss various scenarios about the resource management. This paper describes an ABM which has been designed to formalize the interactions between the biophysics dynamics of the natural resources and the socio-economic factors driving the land-use dynamics around the drilling of Thieul village in the sylvo-pastoral area of Ferlo (Senegal). The first results show that rainfall still plays an extremely significant role in the pastoral system despite the drilling of boreholes. Paradoxically, steady rainfall over long periods of time can lead to negative effects on the relations between herders and farmers.",

            "abstract": "Social simulation—an emerging field of computational social science—has progressed from simple toy models to increasingly realistic models of complex social systems, such as agent- based models where heterogeneous agents interact with changing natural or artificial environments. These larger, multidisciplinary projects require a scientific research methodology distinct from, say, simpler social simulations with more limited scope, intentionally minimal complexity, and typically under a single investigator. This paper proposes a methodology for complex social simulations—particularly inter- and multi-disciplinary socio-natural systems with multi-level architecture—based on a succession of models akin to but distinct from the late Imre Lakatos’ notion of a ’research programme’. The proposed methodology is illustrated through examples from the Mason-Smithsonian project on agent-based models of the rise and fall of polities in Inner Asia. While the proposed methodology requires further development, so far it has proven valuable for advancing the scientific objectives of the project and avoiding some pitfalls",

            "abstract": "Pastoralism represents a complex adaptive system that has existed in Inner Asia for thousands of years. The challenges of environmental change have highlighted the need to assess the potential for long-term sustainability while also considering the characteristics of systems that have the potential to maintain resilience. Here we assess the interaction between slow and fast processes and how interpretations of adaptive capacity and system resilience are affected by the scale at which observations are made. Agent-based modeling is used to identify the social and demographic interactions between landscape and weather variability for pastoralists in Inner Asia at a variety of social scales and from temporal scales of societal change ranging from a few days to 1000 years. Results indicate that the scale of abrupt changes may not be proportional to the severity or duration of the weather event, but is highly impacted by internal social factors. At the scale of individual families, highly interconnected social systems with less mobility and restricted decision making are less effective. When viewed from the vantage point of larger social units, highly interconnected kinship systems and restrictions in access to land may serve purposes that are counterproductive for individual families. ?? 2011.",

Key components of these simulations are representations of initial settlement populations that are demographically and socially plausible, and detailed models of social mechanisms that can produce and maintain realistic textures of social structure and dynamics over time.

            "abstract": "© 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York. Following a strictly theory-building approach, we developed an agent-based simulation model, the Nice Musical Chairs model, to represent the competition between groups of stakeholders of farming and herding activities in the arid Afro-Eurasia. The model dee pens the questions raised by the results of our former model, the Musical Chairs model, and further introduces three socio-economic mechanisms, which modulate the behavior and performance of stakeholders and their groups. First, we define land use pairing as the awarding, regarding productivity, of any direct cooperation between farming and herding within a group. Second, group management is modeled as the prerogative of a group leadership to manage stakeholders to pursue a particular proportion between farming and herding. Third, we introduce restricted access to pasture as the engagement in territorial control of rangelands in opposition to an open access regime. An exhaustive exploration of scenarios and parameters placed the control over rangelands as the most significant factor in the formation of land use patterns, followed by land use management. While the effect of land use pairing is mild in comparison, it is still a significant factor in group selection and thus in the persistence of particular land use patterns in the long run.",

            "abstract": "With a few exceptions, the distant past is an anonymous land occupied by people who made things and left behind a cryptic record of broken pieces. Even when the written word comes into play in human history and we can read the hieroglyphs naming an Egyptian pharaoh and describing royal achievements, the majority of human experience remains unknown and unrecoverable. Archaeologists usually excavate to gather physical evidence from ruins, monuments, and artifacts, which become data streams for the interpretation of past societies. Basic excavation is supplemented by a variety of scientific and historical research methods, all of which are far removed from observing the actual experiences of individuals in the past. Fig. 1. Agent-based modeling is a powerful means for archeologists to explore the connections among individual action, intangible social entities, and broader interpretations at any time scale. If used more widely, ABM could free practitioners from many traditional limitations and make findings translatable to the general scientific public.

The result is that aggregated categories such as households, neighborhoods, cities, nations, and civilizations become the units of analysis. These categories are incredibly important, but they are often used because finer analytical levels are unavailable. Furthermore, the aggregate categories are typically implemented under expectations of classical science, such as equilibrium outcomes that assume normal distributions as well as linear assumptions of cause and effect about rates of change or adaptive processes. These approaches only scratch the surface of complex human dynamics. Unless fine-grained behaviors can be accounted for, the use of standard inferences and analogies only adds more layers of unknown bias to interpretations. Essentially, the past is understood through conceptual tools developed before the mid-20th century. However, innovative computational methods provide a way out of this old conundrum by … [↵][1]1To whom correspondence should be addressed. Email: rogersd{at}si.edu. [1]: #xref-corresp-1-1",

We introduce new epistemological concepts so as to show to what extent authors are right when they focus on some empirical, instrumental or conceptual significance of their model or simulation. By distinguishing between models and simulations, between types of models, between types of computer simulations and between types of empiricity obtained through a simulation, section 2 gives the possibility to understand more precisely - and then to justify - the diversity of the epistemological positions presented in section 1. Our final claim is that careful attention to the multiplicity of the denotational powers of symbols at stake in complex models and computer simulations is necessary to determine, in each case, their proper epistemic status and credibility.",

The target is no more an archaeological artifact but a human society at large, although existing only in the virtual world. A new target, the artificial society, is created with its own structure and behavior. With the possibility of simulating virtual social systems, a new methodology of scientific inquiry becomes possible.</p>",

            "abstract": "This lecture treats some enduring misconceptions about modeling. One of these is that the goal is always prediction. The lecture distinguishes between explanation and prediction as modeling goals, and offers sixteen reasons other than prediction to build a model. It also challenges the common assumption that scientific theories arise from and ’summarize’ data, when often, theories precede and guide data collection; without theory, in other words, it is not clear what data to collect. Among other things, it also argues that the modeling enterprise enforces habits of mind essential to freedom. It is based on the author’s 2008 Bastille Day keynote address to the Second World Congress on Social Simulation, George Mason University, and earlier addresses at the Institute of Medicine, the University of Michigan, and the Santa Fe Institute.",

            "abstract": "Agents are self-contained objects within a software model that are capable of autonomously interacting with the environment and with other agents. Basing a model around agents (building an agent-based model, or ABM) allows the user to build complex models from the bottom up by specifying agent behaviors and the environment within which they operate. This is often a more natural perspective than the system-level perspective required of other modeling paradigms, and it allows greater flexibility to use agents in novel applications. This flexibility makes them ideal as virtual laboratories and testbeds, particularly in the social sciences where direct experimentation may be infeasible or unethical. ABMs have been applied successfully in a broad variety of areas, including heuristic search methods, social science models, combat modeling, and supply chains. This tutorial provides an introduction to tools and resources for prospective modelers, and illustrates ABM flexibility with a basic war-gaming example.",

            "abstract": "Agent-based models (ABMs) are an increasingly popular tool in the social sciences. This trend seems likely to continue, so that they will become widely used in geography and in urban and regional planning. We present an overview of examples of these models in the life sciences, economics, planning, sociology, and archaeology. We conclude that ABMs strongly tend towards an individualist view of the social world. This point is reinforced by closer consideration of particular examples. This discussion pays attention to the inadequacy of an individualist model of society with reference to debates in social theory. We argue that because models are closed representations of an open world it is important that institutions and other social structures be explicitly included, or that their omission be explained. A tentative explanation for the bias of ABMs is offered, based on an examination of early research in artificial intelligence and distributed artificial intelligence from which disciplines the approach is derived. Some implications of these findings are discussed. We indicate some useful research directions which are beginning to tackle the individualism issue directly. We further note that the underlying assumptions of ABMs are often hidden in the implementation details. We conclude that such models must be subject to critical examination of their assumptions, and that model builders should engage with social theory if the approach is to realise its full potential.",

Humans alter fire regimes through increased ignition frequency and by hindering the spread of fire through fire suppression and fuel fragmentation. Here, we present FIRE LADY (FIre REgime and LAndscape DYnamics), a spatially explicit fire regime model that takes into account daily weather data, topography, vegetation growth, fire behaviour, fire suppression and land use changes. In this model, vegetation growth depends on water availability, and stem diameter and stand density are the fundamental parameters. Fire behaviour is modelled using the Rothermel equations and taking into account both crown fire and spotting. Human influences on fire regime, such as ignition frequency, fire suppression and land use changes, are explicitly modelled. The model was calibrated for three regions in NE Spain and reproduces fire regimes, changes in land cover distribution and tree biomass with promising accuracy. The explicit modelling of human influences makes the model a useful and unique tool for assessing the impacts of climate change and informing local fire regime management strategies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

            "abstract": "The Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition was a process of cultural and biological replacement, considered a turning point in human evolutionary history. Various hypotheses have been used to explain the disappearance of Neanderthals from Eurasia. However, very few studies have explicitly examined the causative role of demography on Neanderthal and anatomically modern humans (AMH) interaction. Here we use an integrative method based on computational modelling and the analysis of archaeological data to construct an agent based model that explores the influence of demographic variables (birth and death rates) and mobility (home range size) on the bio-cultural interaction between AMH and Neanderthals during the transition from the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic on the Iberian Peninsula (50 ka to 30 ka BP). Our simulation results are consistent with the current radiocarbon framework for the disappearance of Neanderthals in this region. This suggest that the extinction of Neanderthals could be explained by inter-specific differences in demographic behaviour and mobility patterns compared with AMH.",

            "abstract": "Discrete-element, individual-based and agent-based modelling techniques represent the interactions of individuals or entities with one another and their environments by sets of computational rules. These methods are now being used in geophysics, ecology, zoology, and increasingly in the social sciences. A characteristic is that the \"agents\" are embedded in an environment with which they interact, so that joint evolution of physical, ecological and socio-economic systems can be studied; this makes them of interest in integrated geographical investigation. Of particular interest is the fact that they allow the study of macro-scale emergent behaviour generated by multiple individual actions. Discrete techniques have the potential to create integrated models that cross disciplines. Similar computational methods can be employed to control the spatial search process, deal with irregular or changing boundaries, and to track the evolution of systems where preservation of heterogeneity across space and time is important. The complex series of feedbacks between the different types of system can thus be modelled within a single computational framework. Humans modelled in this way as \"agents\" can allow the collective effect of many interacting individuals to generate emergent structures at the community scale. The structural characteristics of their social and natural environments will influence their behaviour, while at the same time constituting emergent consequences of their actions. The principal challenge of the latter is to find those sets of rules that represent the beliefs and desires of real human agents, accurately reflecting the cultural context, while allowing us to explore the social and economic limitations of agents to take action. This paper reviews and illustrates discrete methods applicable to a range of geographical enquiries, and with particular reference to individual- and agent-based methods, assesses the rich diversity of approaches that must be combined to take full advantage of their potential to explore interactions of social and environmental processes. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

            "abstract": "Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) represents a methodology with significant potential for altering archaeological analytical practice. The continued growth in the number of publications that use ABM provides evidence for the significance of this emerging approach. However, the scope of the research topics investigated has not increased accordingly. A consensus exists among ABM practitioners, that once generally accepted by the field, ABM can make revolutionary advances within the overall archaeological research paradigm. Unresolved concerns within the archaeological community center on whether ABMs are sufficiently grounded in empirical data, are aligned with theoretical trajectories, and on the difficult task of mastering the computational systems. It is worth exploring these aspects of the disjuncture between the mainstream and ABM practitioners for two reasons – to frame a discussion of qualities of ABM that make it transformative and to provide guidelines for broadening ABM’s applicability. With capacity-building in mind, offered here is a practical reference for the non-practitioner archaeologist considering ABM. A glossary is included of key terms used in the text to describe ABM methods and theory.",

            "abstract": "The study of material culture generated by military engagements has created an emergent sub-discipline of archaeological studies centred on battlefields. This approach has developed a particular and sophisticated methodology that is able to deal with the fact that archaeologists will often not find either structures or a useful stratigraphical record on the site, as the material remains of the battle will basically be metallic objects carried by combatants. It is therefore rather complicated not only to test hypotheses about battle events based on archaeological data, but also to validate the methodology used. Here we propose the use of agent-based models to explore these issues in the case of eighteenth-century battlefield archaeology. The simulation is divided into four different steps. Firstly, a battle is simulated in order to generate realistic virtual archaeological remains left by an engagement between two armies of this era. We then simulate the loss of information that the passing of time produces in the battlefield. The third step involves simulating the archaeological survey, enabling us to explore different survey strategies and the impact on the interpretation of the event itself. Finally, we design a confidence index in order to compare the results of the different virtual excavations using spatial analysis and statistics. The results show that the methodology is fully functional in terms of understanding a battle, and it allows us to suggest new strategies to improve fieldwork and to develop new ways of exploring these particular archaeological sites. It is concluded that the described approach illustrates how simulation can be used to explore methodological issues of archaeological science. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

To investigate this issue, we apply the Human-Environment System framework formulated by Scholz (2011) as a conceptual guide to read typical feedback loops in land-use systems. We use an agent-based land-use change model (LUDAS) developed by Le etal. (2008, 2010) to test the sensitivity of long-term land-use dynamics to the inclusion of secondary feedback loop learning with respect to different system performance indicators at different levels of aggregation. Simulation experiments were based on a case study that was carried out in the Hong Ha watershed (Vietnam). We specified two model versions that represent two mechanisms of human adaptation in land-use decisions to environmental changes that emerged from land-use actions. The first mechanism includes only primary feedback loop learning, i.e. households adapt to the annual change in socio-ecological conditions and direct environmental response to land-use activities. The second mechanism includes the first one and secondary feedback loop learning, in which households can change their behavioural model in response to changes in socio-ecological conditions at the landscape-community level in the longer term. Spatial-temporal patterns of land-use and interrelated community income changes driven from the two feedback mechanisms are compared in order to evaluate the added value of the inclusion of secondary feedback loop learning. The results demonstrate that the effect of the added secondary feedback loop learning on land-use dynamics depends on domain type, time scale, and aggregation level of the impact indicators. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

This paper surveys the basic theories and methods of hybrid agent modeling in population simulation emerged recent years. We first introduce the framework of this hybrid agent based population generation. The current approaches of initial database synthesis including sample based and sample free methods are then discussed in detail, followed by a brief comparison of these methods. In addition, the major types and characteristics of agent models and their applications are also reviewed. Finally, we conclude by outlining the future directions of population research using agent technology",

            "abstract": "We review agent-based models (ABM) of human migration with respect to their decision-making rules. The most prominent behavioural theories used as decision rules are the random utility theory, as implemented in the discrete choice model, and the theory of planned behaviour. We identify the critical choices that must be made in developing an ABM, namely the modelling of decision processes and social networks. We also discuss two challenges that hamper the widespread use of ABM in the study of migration and, more broadly, demography and the social sciences: (a) the choice and the operationalisation of a behavioural theory (decision-making and social interaction) and (b) the selection of empirical evidence to validate the model. We offer advice on how these challenges might be overcome.",

            "abstract": "The “ODD” (Overview, Design concepts, and Details) protocol was published in 2006 to standardize the published descriptions of individual-based and agent-based models (ABMs). The primary objectives of ODD are to make model descriptions more understandable and complete, thereby making ABMs less subject to criticism for being irreproducible. We have systematically evaluated existing uses of the ODD protocol and identified, as expected, parts of ODD needing improvement and clarification. Accordingly, we revise the definition of ODD to clarify aspects of the original version and thereby facilitate future standardization of ABM descriptions. We discuss frequently raised critiques in ODD but also two emerging, and unanticipated, benefits: ODD improves the rigorous formulation of models and helps make the theoretical foundations of large models more visible. Although the protocol was designed for ABMs, it can help with documenting any large, complex model, alleviating some general objections against such models.",

            "abstract": "Social influence is one of the most important processes in human social interaction. Very often in human social interaction, influence is assimilative in that individuals become more similar to others they interact with. Nevertheless, cultural differences continue to remain in many realms of human life, for example, in the form of technological boundaries. Research on social influence points to a range ofpossible reasons for persistent cultural diversity, but there is much less clarity about the interplay of various factors and conditions for cultural influence with fundamental processes of social interaction at the micro-level. In this article, I show how agent- based computational modeling can be used as an approach for unraveling the complex interplay between simple first principles of interpersonal social interaction and emergent societal outcomes. I give a briefoverview illustrating some ofthe main approaches agent-based modelers have developed in recent decades to understand conditions and processes of the emergence of cultural diversity. Models will be discussed that generate mainly cultural consensus as long-term behavior, but also models that generate clustering of cultural attitudes in geographical or social space, and models that imply cultural polarization with sharp cultural boundaries between emergent factions. It will be discussed how model dynamics depend on further assumptions, for example about random events, or the scaling of cultural attitudes, and what are further developments in the literature, possible future directions and challenges for the application of computational agent-based modeling in archeological research on cultural boundaries.",

            "abstract": "Long House Valley in the Black Mesa area of northeastern Arizona (U.S.) was inhabited by the Kayenta Anasazi from about 1800 before Christ to about anno Domini 1300. These people were prehistoric ancestors of the modern Pueblo cultures of the Colorado Plateau. Paleoenvironmental research based on alluvial geomorphology, palynology, and dendroclimatology permits accurate quantitative reconstruction of annual fluctuations in potential agricultural production (kg of maize per hectare). The archaeological record of Anasazi farming groups from anno Domini 200-1300 provides information on a millennium of sociocultural stasis, variability, change, and adaptation. We report on a multiagent computational model of this society that closely reproduces the main features of its actual history, including population ebb and flow, changing spatial settlement patterns, and eventual rapid decline. The agents in the model are monoagriculturalists, who decide both where to situate their fields as well as the location of their settlements. Nutritional needs constrain fertility. Agent heterogeneity, difficult to model mathematically, is demonstrated to be crucial to the high fidelity of the model.",

            "abstract": "Representing human decisions is of fundamental importance in agent-based models. However, the rationale for choosing a particular human decision model is often not sufficiently empirically or theoretically substantiated in the model documentation. Furthermore, it is difficult to compare models because the model descriptions are often incomplete, not transparent and difficult to understand. Therefore, we expand and refine the “ODD” (Overview, Design Concepts and Details) protocol to establish a standard for describing ABMs that includes human decision-making (ODD + D). Because the ODD protocol originates mainly from an ecological perspective, some adaptations are necessary to better capture human decision-making. We extended and rearranged the design concepts and related guiding questions to differentiate and describe decision-making, adaptation and learning of the agents in a comprehensive and clearly structured way. The ODD + D protocol also incorporates a section on “Theoretical and Empirical Background” to encourage model designs and model assumptions that are more closely related to theory. The application of the ODD + D protocol is illustrated with a description of a social–ecological ABM on water use. Although the ODD + D protocol was developed on the basis of example implementations within the socio-ecological scientific community, we believe that the ODD + D protocol may prove helpful for describing ABMs in general when human decisions are included.",

            "abstract": "Agent-based modeling promises to overcome the reification of actors. Whereas this common, but limiting, assumption makes a lot of sense during periods characterized by stable actor boundaries, other historical junctures, such as the end of the Cold War, exhibit far-reaching and swift transformations of actors’ spatial and organizational existence. Moreover, because actors cannot be assumed to remain constant in the long run, analysis of macrohistorical processes virtually always requires \"sociational\" endogenization. This paper presents a series of computational models, implemented with the software package REPAST, which trace complex macrohistorical transformations of actors be they hierarchically organized as relational networks or as collections of symbolic categories. With respect to the former, dynamic networks featuring emergent compound actors with agent compartments represented in a spatial grid capture organizational domination of the territorial state. In addition, models of \"tagged\" social processes allows the analyst to show how democratic states predicate their behavior on categorical traits. Finally, categorical schemata that select out politically relevant cultural traits in ethnic landscapes formalize a constructivist notion of national identity in conformance with the qualitative literature on nationalism. This \"finite-agent method\", representing both states and nations as higher-level structures superimposed on a lower-level grid of primitive agents or cultural traits, avoids reification of agency. Furthermore, it opens the door to explicit analysis of entity processes, such as the integration and disintegration of actors as well as boundary transformations.",

            "abstract": "Simulation models that describe autonomous individual organisms (individual based models, IBM) or agents (agent-based models, ABM) have become a widely used tool, not only in ecology, but also in many other disciplines dealing with complex systems made up of autonomous entities. However, there is no standard protocol for describing such simulation models, which can make them difficult to understand and to duplicate. This paper presents a proposed standard protocol, ODD, for describing IBMs and ABMs, developed and tested by 28 modellers who cover a wide range of fields within ecology. This protocol consists of three blocks (Overview, Design concepts, and Details), which are subdivided into seven elements: Purpose, State variables and scales, Process overview and scheduling, Design concepts, Initialization, Input, and Submodels. We explain which aspects of a model should be described in each element, and we present an example to illustrate the protocol in use. In addition, 19 examples are available in an Online Appendix. We consider ODD as a first step for establishing a more detailed common format of the description of IBMs and ABMs. Once initiated, the protocol will hopefully evolve as it becomes used by a sufficiently large proportion of modellers.",

We argue that replication has even greater benefits when applied to computational models than when applied to physical experiments. Replication affects model verification, in that it aids in determining if the implemented model reflects the conceptual model. It affects model validation, since a replication of a conceptual model may change the output from an implemented model and thus alter the correspondence between the model and the real world. Replication also affects validation by forcing the model developer and replicator to re-examine assumptions made in the original model. In addition replication fosters shared understanding of the details of modeling decisions within the research community. To facilitate the practice of replication, we argue for the creation of standards for both how to replicate models and how to evaluate the replication. In this paper, we present a case study of our attempt to replicate an ABM developed by Axelrod and Hammond. We detail our effort to replicate that model and the challenges that arose in recreating the model and in determining if the replication was successful.",

As a case study, the MERCURY model by Brughmans and Poblome is replicated. In the first chapter, a background is given to ABM in general, as well as to replic- ation and its importance and scarcity. Replication allows us to confirm the findings of existing ABM models, or reject them. The second chapter gives an abstract of Brughmans and Poblome’s research. It includes the archaeological background to their research, a precise description of the MERCURY model and a summary of Brughmans and Poblome’s conclusions. In chapter three, the process of replicating MERCURY is explained. Each ver- sion of the replication is described in great detail. This final version is statistically compared to the original model. The replication was found to be, for the most part, statistically equivalent to the original. The source of the despondencies between the various versions of the replication and the original model were due to inaccuracies in the description of the model as well as due to my own coding mistakes. Chapter four includes a brief discussion of existing criticism of the MERCURY model, as well as my own critiques. These critiques are mostly concern the details of the model and the way the authors interpreted their data. Additional experiments are performed to complement the experiments in the original study. I conclude that some of the issues I identify could weaken the original authors’ conclusions. The relation of my replication of MERCURY to other replication studies is dis- cussed in chapter five. The final chapter my research questions are answered. I also shortly discuss how my experiences with replication could help future researches who want to pub- lish agent-based models or replication studies.",

            "abstract": "Since the advent of computers, the natural and engineering sciences have enormously progressed. Computer simulations allow one to understand interactions of physical particles and make sense of astronomical observations, to describe many chemical properties ab initio, and to design energy-efficient aircrafts and safer cars. Today, the use of computational devices is pervasive. Offices, administrations, financial trading, economic exchange, the control of infrastructure networks, and a large share of our communication would not be conceivable without the use of computers anymore. Hence, it would be very surprising, if computers could not make a contribution to a better understanding of social and economic systems. While relevant also for the statistical analysis of data and data-driven efforts to reveal patterns of human interaction 1, we will focus here on the prospects of computer simulation of social and economic systems. More specifically, we will discuss the techniques of agent-based modeling (ABM) and multi-agent simulation (MAS), including the challenges, perspectives and limitations of the approach. In doing so, we will discuss a number of issues, which have not been covered by the excellent books and review papers available so far 210. In particular, we will describe the different steps belonging to a thorough agent-based simulation study, and try to explain, how to do them right from a scientific perspective. To some extent, computer simulation can be seen as experimental technique for hypothesis testing and scenario analysis, which can be used complementary and in combination with experiments in real-life, the lab or the Web",

            "abstract": "Sociologists often model social processes as interactions among vari- ables.We review an alternative approach that models social life as interactions among adaptive agents who influence one another in response to the influence they receive. These agent-based models (ABMs) showhowsimple and predictable local interactions can generate familiarbut enigmatic global patterns, such as the diffusion of information, emergence of norms, coordination of conventions, or participation in collective action. Emergent social patterns can also appear unexpectedly and then just as dramatically transform or disappear, as happens in revolutions, market crashes, fads, and feeding frenzies. ABMs provide theoretical leverage where the global patterns of interest are more than the aggregation of individual attributes, but at the same time, the emergent pattern cannot be understood without a bottom up dynamical model of the microfoun- dations at the relational level.We begin with a brief historical sketch of the shift from “factors” to “actors” in computational sociology that shows howagent-based modeling differs fundamentally from earlier sociological uses of computer simulation.We then reviewrecent contributions focused on the emergence of social structure and social or- der out of local interaction. Although sociology has lagged behind other social sciences in appreciating this newmethodology, a distinctive sociological contribution is evident in the papers we review. First, theoretical interest focuses on dynamic social networks that shape and are shaped by agent interaction. Second, ABMs are used to perform virtual experiments that test macrosociological theories by manipulating structural fac- tors like network topology, social stratification, or spatial mobility. We conclude our review with a series of recommendations for realizing the rich sociological potential of this approach.",

            "abstract": "Human mobility always had a great influence on the spreading of cultural, social and technological ideas. Developing realistic models that allow for a better understanding, prediction and control of such coupled processes has gained a lot of attention in recent years. However, the modeling of spreading processes that happened in ancient times faces the additional challenge that available knowledge and data is often limited and sparse. In this paper, we present a new agent-based model for the spreading of innovations in the ancient world that is governed by human movements. Our model considers the diffusion of innovations on a spatial network that is changing in time, as the agents are changing their positions. Additionally, we propose a novel stochastic simulation approach to produce spatio-temporal realizations of the spreading process that are instructive for studying its dynamical properties and exploring how different influences affect its speed and spatial evolution.",

            "abstract": "Behavioral experiments have demonstrated that people do cooperate in commons dilemmas. There are alternative theories that are proposed to explain the data. We will use agent-based models to compare alternative behavioral theories on a series of experimental data of irrigation games. The irrigation dilemma captures situations of asymmetric access to common resources while contributions of all participants are needed to maintain the physical infrastructure. In our model analysis we compare various alternative theories, including naïve simple ones like selfish rational actors and altruistic actors. We contrast these with various alternative behavioral models for collective action as well as inclusion of other-regarding preferences. The systematic comparison of alternative models on experimental data from 44 groups enables us to test which behavioral theories best explain the observed effects of communication. We do not find that one theory clearly outperform others in explaining the data.",

            "abstract": "According to the Out of Africa theory early hominins originated in Africa subsequently dispersing into Eurasia. At least two dispersal events are documented, during which Pleistocene hominins left the African continent. Out of Africa 1 refers to the early hominin dispersal prior to Homo sapiens (e.g. Homo erectus/ergaster) while Out of Africa 2 deals with the dispersal of H. sapiens. Many hypotheses try to explain why early hominins dispersed beyond the African continent. Suggested causes include factors such as climate, geography, vegetation, demography, competition, ecology and cognition. However, no attempt has been made yet to model the hypotheses’ mechanisms explicitly in order to compare them on a quantitative scale. We therefore explore the potential of agent-based modeling. An agent-based model consists of the acting entities, the so-called agents, an environment and rules of interaction among them. We analyzed the most common Out of Africa hypotheses and systematically formalized them by aid of an agent-based modeling framework. Our results show that the most common Out of Africa hypotheses can be attributed to at least four different scenarios. We refer to the scenarios as environmental, demographic, resource driven, ecology and cognition based scenarios. Our study provides a framework that helps designing agent-based models with respect to the dispersal of early hominins out of the African continent.",

            "abstract": "Agent-based modelling has become an important tool to investigate socio-ecological processes. Its use is partially driven by increasing demand from decision makers to provide support for understanding the potential implications of decisions in complex situations. While one of the advantages of agent-based modelling is the ability to simulate the implications of human decision-making processes explicitly, methods for providing empirical support for the representation of the behaviour of human agents have not been structured systematically. This paper develops a framework for the parameterisation of human behaviour in agent-based models and develops twelve distinct sequences for the characterisation and parameterisation of human behaviours. Examples are provided to illustrate the most important sequences. This framework is a first step towards a guide for parameterisation of human behaviour in ABM. A structured discussion within the agent-based community is needed to achieve a more definitive guideline. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",

            "abstract": "Ancient regional routes were vital for interactions between settlements and deeply influenced the development of past societies and their “complexification”. At the same time, since any transportation infrastructure needs some level of inter-settlement cooperation to be established, they can also be regarded as an epiphenomenon of social interactions at the regional scale. Here, we propose to analyze ancient pathway networks to understand the organization of cities and villages located in a certain territory, attempting to clarify whether such organization existed and if so, how it functioned. To address such a question, we chose a quantitative approach. Adopting network science as a general framework, by means of formal models, we try to identify how the collective effort that produced the terrestrial infrastructure was directed and organized. We selected a paradigmatic case study: Iron Age southern Etruria, a very well-studied context, with detailed archaeological information about settlement patterns and an established tradition of studies on terrestrial transportation routes, perfectly suitable for testing new techniques. The results of the modelling suggest that a balanced coordinated decision-making process was shaping the route network in Etruria, a scenario which correlates well with the picture elaborated by different scholars using a more traditional technique.",

            "abstract": "The archaeological record has been described as a key to the long-term consequences of human action that can help guide our decisions today. Yet the sparse and incomplete nature of this record often makes it impossible to inferentially reconstruct past societies in sufficient detail for them to serve as more than very general cautionary tales of coupled socio-ecological systems. However, when formal and computational modeling is used to experimentally simulate human socioecological dynamics, the empirical archaeological record can be used to validate and improve dynamic models of long term change. In this way, knowledge generated by archaeology can play a unique and valuable role in developing the tools to make more informed decisions that will shape our future. The Mediterranean Landscape Dynamics project offers an example of using the past to develop and test computational models of interactions between land-use and landscape evolution that ultimately may help guide decision-making.",

Selfishness seems to be favored by natural selection. While this presents a classical dilemma in many fields, cooperation is observed at all levels of biological organization. By preserving the common good, cooperation may guarantee better survival chances for all. Evolution and maintenance of cooperation are possible by a combination of multiple mechanisms including reciprocity, which in primates and particularly in humans is largely dependent on memory and the ability to exchange social information, a function of language. In this article, we present a multi-agent model developed with the aim of evaluating the importance of memory in cognitive and social adaptations for cooperation based on reciprocity when populations are under ecological stress. We show that in a society under ecological pressure, the reciprocity network permitted by collaborative memory promotes cooperation.",

            "abstract": "Archaeological analyses often detect abrupt changes over time in the hierarchy of settlement sizes and the spatial distribution of residential units. These transformations have been explained looking at a variety of possible causes, from climatic changes to the sudden release of slowly cumulating political tensions. While many of these models offer plausible explanations for specific historical contexts, a broad-breadth model is desirable if cross-cultural analysis is sought. This paper tackles this problem by starting from the theoretical proposition that human groups are characterised by a non-linear relationship between size and per-capita fitness. Increasing group size has beneficial effects, but once a certain threshold is exceeded, negative frequency dependence will start to predominate leading to a decline in the per-capita fitness. Such a relationship can potentially have long-term implications in the spatial structure of human settlements if individuals have the possibility to modify their fitness through group fission-fusion dynamics. I will illustrate the equilibrium properties of these dynamics by means of an abstract agent-based simulation and discuss its implication for understanding long-term changes in human settlement pattern. Results suggest that changes in settlement pattern can originate from internal dynamics alone if the system is highly integrated and interconnected. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

            "abstract": "At the root of numerous archaeological research projects is a need to understand how mobility impacted the lives of our ancestors. Recent technological advances have made it easy for archaeologists to rely on Geographic Information Systems’ least-cost path tools to identify the single easiest path to move between two points set in a realistically rugged landscape; however, least-cost path tools work on the assumption that the whole world is perfectly known, which does not represent human mobility accurately in all cases. Here, we present an agent-based least-cost path (AB-LCP) model, which does not make the assumption of complete landscape knowledge, and allows creating multiple anisotropic least-cost paths that take the traveler’s local perspective and incomplete knowledge into consideration. We demonstrate the model’s potential through a case study of the geographical distribution of Cantabrian (Spain) Lower Magdalenian engraved scapulae, which provides an interesting extension to current understanding of Magdalenian mobility, showcasing the flexibility and potential of this new LCP tool to study archaeological landscapes. The results of our study suggest that the studied engraved scapulae may have been created at El Castillo, and then brought to Altamira for transmission to other sites. The results show that El Castillo was strategically located on a bottleneck for coastal-to-plain mobility, whereas Altamira was located along social paths connecting other contemporaneous sites. This supports the already-accepted notion that both sites may have served for Upper Paleolithic population aggregation. However, our research builds on this idea by explaining why these two sites would have become so important. We suggest that Altamira was strategically placed near the boundary of inter-regional groups, thus taking the role as an aggregation site for unrelated populations, whereas El Castillo would have been used by the intra-regional group population to congregate during the summer and take advantage of the local mosaic of resources.",

In essence, we argue for a more discursive, dialogic approach that places modeling in the arena of narrative construction, rather than the pursuit of some representation of \"reality.\" © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",

Almost all rely on depression filling to facilitate drainage analysis. This study proposes an intuitive and relatively simple depression-filling algorithm, which is readily applicable to raster and irregular datasets. In this study, topographic data of two watershed areas were provided to test the capability of this new algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm can accurately identify the locations of depressions and efficiently assign pseudo flow directions across the filled depressions.",

            "abstract": "Social and computational archaeology focuses largely on the study of past societies and the evolution of human behaviour. At the same time, agent-based models (ABMs) allow the efficient modeling of human agency, and the quantitative representation and exploration of specific properties and patterns in archaeological information. In this work we put forward a novel agent-based trading model, for simulating the exchange and distribution of resources across settlements in past societies. The model is part of a broader ABM populated with autonomous, utility-seeking agents corresponding to households; with the ability to employ any spatial interaction model of choice. As such, it allows the study of the settlements’ trading ability and power, given their geo-location and their position within the trading network, and the structural properties of the network itself. As a case study we use the Minoan society during the Bronze Age, in the wider area of “Knossos” on the island of Crete, Greece. We instantiate two well-known spatial interaction sub-models, XTENT and Gravity, and conduct a systematic evaluation of the dynamic trading network that is formed over time. Our simulations assess the sustainability of the artificial Minoan society in terms of population size, number and distribution of agent communities, with respect to the available archaeological data and spatial interaction model employed; and, further, evaluate the resulting trading network’s structure (centrality, clustering, etc.) and how it affects inter-settlement organization, providing in the process insights and support for archaeological hypotheses on the settlement organization in place at the time. Our results show that when the trading network is modeled using Gravity, which focuses on the settlements’ “importance” rather than proximity to each other, settlement numbers’ evolution patterns emerge that are similar to the ones that exist in the archaeological record. It can also be inferred by our simulations that a rather dense trading network, without a strict settlement hierarchy, could have emerged during the Late Minoan period, after the Theran volcanic eruption, a well documented historic catastrophic event. Moreover, it appears that the trading network’s structure and interaction patterns are reversed after the Theran eruption, when compared to those in effect in earlier periods.",

The dynamic urban retail model (Harris and Wilson, Environ Plan A 10:371-388, 1978) is one of the most well known applications of this technique and is an example of a BLV (Boltzmann-Lotka-Volterra) model. We define an agent-based model (ABM) of urban retail and explore whether it can be made equivalent to a BLV model. Application of both models to the metropolitan county of South Yorkshire in the UK indicates that both models produce similar outputs. This direct comparison provides some insights into the differences and similarities of each approach, as well as highlighting the relative strengths and weaknesses. The ABM has the potential to be easier to disaggregate, while the entropy maximising model is more computationally efficient.",

            "abstract": "With an increasing world population and with more cost effective transportation, mass gatherings become ever more frequent. The total size of such gatherings is often as large as millions of people. Furthermore, everyday life in cities becomes increasingly crowded with people. This development has prompted better solutions to mitigate crowded places and make them safer as well as more efficient in terms of travel time. One way to approach this crowd problem is to use crowd modeling tools to assess and optimize locations where pedestrian crowds move around. Within the last decade, crowd modeling has become a mature science and there now exist well calibrated pedestrian models that can reproduce empirically observed crowd features. In this chapter, we will introduce the field of crowd modeling, explain how crowd models can be calibrated with empirical data, and expand a bit on how navigation works in these models.",

With its generative emphasis on micro-dynamics of complex systems and its flexible treatment of space, time, pattern, and process, it marks a significant departure from traditionally employed coarse, static approaches. The primacy of geography in geosimulation also represents a departure for spatial simulation from its reliance on modeling methods borrowed from economics and physics, which were often ported to spatial applications because of tractability, but without consideration of the suitability of the fit. Research in geosimulation, while still nascent in its development, has been particularly active in urban applications, where the technique has considerably expanded the range of questions and ideas that can be explored in simulation. This chapter reviews the origins of urban geosimulation, discusses the state-of-the-art relative to urban applications, and speculates about potential future avenues of inquiry in the field.",

            "abstract": "Due to the complexity of human behaviour and the intricacies of the urban environment, it is extremely difficult to understanding and model crime patterns. Nevertheless, a greater understanding of the processes and drivers behind crime is essential for researchers to be able to properly model crime and for policy-makers to be able to predict the potential effects of their interventions. Traditional mathematical models that use spatially aggregated data struggle to capture the low-level dynamics of the crime system - such as an individual person’s behaviour - and hence fail to encapsulate the factors that characterise the system and lead to the emergence of city-wide crime rates.This chapter will outline a realistic agent-based model that can be used to simulate, at the level of individual houses and offenders, occurrences of crime in a real city. In particular, the research focuses on the crime of residential burglary in the city of Leeds, UK. The model is able to predict which places might have a heightened burglary risk as a direct result of a real urban regeneration scheme in the local area.",

The chapter reviews the issues and challenges arising from the difficulties of integrating space in agent-based modeling. It outlines the emerging trend towards improving the level of realism in representing space, which can lead not only to an enhanced comprehension of model design and outcomes, but to an enhanced theoretical and empirical grounding of the entire field of agent-based modelling.",

            "abstract": "This chapter provides a review and examples of approaches to model scaling when constructing large agent-based models. A comparison is made between an aggregate “super-individual” approach, as run on a single processor machine, and two different approaches to parallelisation of agent models run on multi-core hardware. Super-individuals provide a straightforward solution without much alteration of the model formulation and result in large improvements in model efficiency (speed and memory use). However, there are significant challenges to using a super-individual approach when relating super-individuals to individuals in time and space. Parallel computing approaches accept the requirement for large amounts of memory or CPU and attempt to solve the problem by distributing the calculation over many computational units. This requires some modification of the model software and algorithms to distribute the model components across multiple computational cores. This can be achieved in a number of different ways, two of which we illustrate further for the case of spatial models, an “agent-parallel” and an “environment-parallel” approach. However, the success of such approaches may also be affected by the complexity of the model (such as multiple agent types and agent interactions), as we illustrate by adding a predator to our example simulation. Between these two parallelisation approaches to the case study, the environment-parallel version of the model, written in C++ instead of Java, proved more efficient and successful at handling parallel processing of complex agent interactions. In conclusion, we use our experiences of creating large agent-based simulations to provide some general guidelines for best practice in agent-based model scaling.",

The spectrum of ABM types from simple, abstract models to complicated models aspiring to realism makes a single answer impossible. Therefore we focus on identifying circumstances where the advantages of ABMs outweigh the additional effort involved. We first recall the reasons for building any model: to simplify the phenomena at hand to improve understanding. Thus, the representational detail of ABMs may not always be desirable. We suggest that critical aspects of the phenomena of interest that help us to assess the likely usefulness of ABMs are the nature of the decisions which actors make, and how their decisions relate to the spatio-temporal grain and extent of the system. More specifically, the heterogeneity of the decision-making context of actors, the importance of interaction effects, and the overall size and organization of the system must be considered. We conclude by suggesting that there are good grounds based on our discussion for ABMs to become a widely used approach in understanding many spatial systems.",

            "abstract": "In this chapter we introduce an approach to individual based modelling of social and economic systems. Microsimulation models (MSM) appear similar to ABM through the representation of individual decision-making units, but there is a significant variation of emphasis between the two approaches. MSM are typically stochastic or rule-based, and with a strong applied policy focus. These characteristics are explored and elaborated through a number of examples. While MSM are often very rich in their representation of “structures”, ABM are usually better tuned to the analysis of “behaviours”. We therefore argue that there is a strong logic to considering the MSM and ABM approaches as complementary and to begin a search for hybrids which might combine the best features of both approaches.",

It begins by outlining the meaning and rationale for agent-based models/modelling (ABM), focusing on their history, how they evolved and how they sit within the broader context of modelling and simulation for geographical systems. Three themes which we see essential to ABM are then outlined, namely the question of detail versus model and data parsimony of which ABM represents the former, questions of model validation that flow from this, and lastly issues about the extent to which ABM is a generic or specific style in terms of applications. We examine the essence of such models in terms of the way behaviour is modelled using various rules, and then we discuss technical issues such as computation, visualization, error, and schemes for model design. All this sets the context for the various chapters that follow. We conclude by explaining briefly what is contained in each chapter and by guiding the reader in how best to use this book.",

            "abstract": "Across a number of countries in Asia and the Caucasus, fertility decline in recent decades has been accompanied by an unprecedented and anomalous rise in the sex ratio at birth (SRB). Although the micro-level factors—persistent son preference within a context of fertility decline and growing access to pre-natal sex determination technology—are known, their specific levels, trends and interactions in explaining macro-level SRB trajectories are hard to discern with existing data and approaches. We present an agent-based model (ABM) that examines the contribution of each of these micro-level factors to the emergence of distorted SRBs at the macro-level. Calibrating our model to the South Korean and Indian scenarios, we show that even as son preference was declining in both settings SRB distortions emerged due to the diffusion of technology along with increases in probabilities to sex-selectively abort at lower parities as norms shifted towards smaller families. In South Korea, we find that SRBs peaked at 114 at relatively low levels of son preference of ∼ 30 % wanting a son. The SRB increase was due to the joint effects of technology diffusion combined with steady increases in the readiness to abort, including small increases at parity 0, that is, before the transition to first birth. In India, our model suggests that the SRB rise was less steep than South Korea’s as the readiness to abort was not as high as in South Korea, due to higher fertility levels when SRBs rose and slower technology diffusion.",

In many cases, our estimates confirm the conjectures of historians who follow different methodologies. In some instances, our estimates confirm one conjecture against others. We also structurally estimate ancient city sizes and offer evidence in support of the hypothesis that large cities tend to emerge at the intersections of natural transport routes, as dictated by topography. Finally, we document persistent patterns in the distribution of city sizes across four millennia, find a distance elasticity of trade in the Bronze Age close to modern estimates, and show suggestive evidence that the distribution of ancient city sizes, inferred from trade data, is well approximated by Zipf’s law.",

            "abstract": "Over the past decade, a major debate has taken place on the underpinnings of cultural changes in human societies. A growing array of evidence in behavioural and evolutionary biology has revealed that social connectivity among populations and within them affects, and is affected by, culture. Yet the interplay between prehistoric hunter–gatherer social structure and cultural transmission has typically been overlooked. Interestingly, the archaeological record contains large data sets, allowing us to track cultural changes over thousands of years: they thus offer a unique opportunity to shed light on long-term cultural transmission processes. In this review, we demonstrate how well-developed methods for social structure analysis can increase our understanding of the selective pressures underlying cumulative culture. We propose a multilevel analytical framework that considers finer aspects of the complex social structure in which regional groups of prehistoric hunter–gatherers were embedded. We put forward predictions of cultural transmission based on local- and global-level network metrics of small-scale societies and their potential effects on cumulative culture. By bridging the gaps between network science, palaeodemography and cultural evolution, we draw attention to the use of the archaeological record to depict patterns of social interactions and transmission variability. We argue that this new framework will contribute to improving our understanding of social interaction patterns, as well as the contexts in which cultural changes occur. Ultimately, this may provide insights into the evolution of human behaviour.",

            "abstract": "While network techniques are now used with some frequency in archaeology for tackling questions of connectivity and mobility at regional and inter-regional scales, they are still somewhat underexploited for more local scales. The considerable potential for multiscalar analysis has recently seen some progress, however, wedded to the idea of communities of practice. In this paper, I consider how this multiscalar approach could aid in the study of ancient globalizations, with the particular case of Minoanization from the Aegean Bronze Age. Although this specific problem has seen some network applications, they have mostly not been multiscalar in nature. I address some of the reasons for this state of affairs, using a distinction between “theory” and “data” models—and suggest some possible outcomes of a more explicitly multiscalar approach to Minoanization.",

            "abstract": "The colonization of the Caribbean initiated a process of entanglement of people, goods, and ideas between the “New” and “Old World,” which is popularly referred to as the Columbian Exchange. This paper seeks to highlight the multiscalar and material underpinnings of this process of global importance by tracing it to its roots: the earliest encounters between the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean and European colonists. We present a database, based on key Spanish historical sources, which catalogs all references to the transaction of objects between Amerindians and Europeans from AD 1492–1497. We furthermore argue for the need of a framework that is able to connect, explore, and track the structural materiality of things in encounter events. For this we suggest a combination of entanglement theory with network and substantive analyses. This multiscalar theoretical and methodological framework shows how a diverse and contextually specific network of humans and things arose in tandem with European and Amerindian attempts to establish, manipulate, and contest ties of significant personal and historical interest.",

L’étude des structures locales, de la relation des nodes et des nœuds au sein des réseaux, en particulier dyadiques et triadiques, est considérée depuis longtemps comme un domaine important pour les analyses de réseaux sociaux. Toutefois, ce domaine est resté virtuellement ignoré des archéologues. Faute de données abondantes, ils ont surtout axé leurs études de réseaux entiers sur une échelle macro, ou bien sur celle du rôle de nœuds spécifiques dans des réseaux. Des études à échelle micro permettent d’aborder les propriétés structurelles du réseau et peuvent servir à comparer des caractéristiques de réseaux qui ne seraient pas perceptibles à partir de mesures de densités ou d’autres mesures de connectivité à macro-échelle. Cet article aborde les concepts de triade et de transitivité et les met en œuvre avec une étude de cas : les réseaux de sites archéologiques liés par la présence de types d’artefacts particuliers dans la péninsule italienne à la fin de l’âge de Bronze. Il démontre que des études à micro-échelle de ce type peuvent apporter des informations nouvelles sur la structure des réseaux archéologiques.",

            "abstract": "The modelling of social-ecological systems can provide useful insights into the interaction of social and environmental processes. However, quantitative social-ecological models should acknowledge the complexity and uncertainty of both underlying subsystems. For example, the agent-based models which are increasingly popular for groundwater studies can be made more realistic by incorporating geohydrological processes. Conversely, groundwater models can benefit from an agent-based depiction of the decision-making and feedbacks which drive groundwater exploitation. From this perspective, this work introduces a Python-based software architecture which couples the NetLogo agent-based platform with the MODFLOW/SEAWAT geohydrological modelling environment. This approach enables users to design agent-based models in NetLogo’s user-friendly platform, while benefiting from the full capabilities of MODFLOW/SEAWAT. This workflow is illustrated for a simplified application of Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES).",

            "abstract": "Despite significant expansion in recent years, the literature on quantitative and data-driven approaches to economic agent-based model validation and calibration consists primarily of studies that have focused on the introduction of new calibration methods that are neither benchmarked against existing alternatives nor rigorously tested in terms of the quality of the estimates they produce. In response, we compare a number of prominent agent-based model calibration methods, both established and novel, through a series of computational experiments in an attempt to determine the respective strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Overall, we find that a simple, likelihood-based approach to Bayesian estimation consistently outperforms several members of the more popular class of simulated minimum distance methods and results in reasonable parameter estimates in many contexts, with a degradation in performance observed only when considering a large-scale model and attempting to fit a substantial number of its parameters.",

            "abstract": "Temporary employment has become a focus of policy debate, theory, and research. This book addresses the relationship between temporary employment contracts and employee well-being. It does so within the analytic framework of the psychological contract, and advances theory and knowledge about the psychological contract by exploring it from a variety of perspectives. It also sets the psychological contract within the context of a range of other potential influences on work-related well-being including workload, job insecurity, employability, and organizational support. The book identifies the relative importance of these various potential influences on well-being, covering seven countries; Belgium, Germany, The Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the UK, as well as Israel as a comparator outside Europe. The book’s conclusions are interesting and controversial. The central finding is that contrary to expectations, temporary workers report higher well-being than permanent workers. As expected, a range of factors help to explain variations in work-related well-being and the research highlights the important role of the psychological contract. However, even after taking into account alternative explanations, the significant influence of type of employment contract remains, with temporary workers reporting higher well-being. In addition to this core finding, by exploring several aspects of the psychological contract, and taking into account both employer and employee perspectives, the book sheds light on the nature and role of the psychological contract. It also raises some challenging policy questions and while acknowledging the potentially precarious nature of temporary jobs, highlights the need to consider the increasingly demanding nature of permanent jobs and their effects on the well-being of employees.",

Looks at Mayan examples of models that their various failures (e.g., lack of spatiality). Key issues: (a) need much ground knowledge or our assumptions can lead us astray; (b) theoretical grounding sway us (obvious but needs to be remembered). A simulation simply a running of a model and gives its results given certain parameters as opposed to reasoning the answer analytically. All models have different degrees of complexity measured by the number of aspects of the target they lay claim to. Problems in typical models are creation of spurious relations, incorrect ones, or ones of insufficient specificity (e.g., something will happen but no where or when). Aims: exploratory, focused, part of a design project. Traditions of models: (a) numerical, differential and recurrence (e.g., logistic chaos models); (b) stochastic models similar to those above but with uncertainty expressed in probability distributions (e.g., Lowe’s Mayan work); (c) operations research models borrowing from the two above but designed for computers (e.g., “next event” models that look to next event vs. just a time step); (d) AI coming in various flavors like symbolic (e.g., expert systems), multiple agent (e.g., DAI), and formal logic specifications. Problems of modeling: (a) choosing which method, must be robust but not too robust; (b) statement of objectives {affected by research background and theory}; (c) assumptions and justifying them, constraint modeling (e.g., rational man); (d) interpretation, such as what constitutes emergence; (e) implementation of simulation (e.g., computationally intensive, hard to interpret, machine artifacts such as random number generators); (f) relation of modeling problems to aspects of theory (e.g., problems of bounded rationality and then further problems of operationalizing this). Aspects of AS: (a) Environment; (b) Complexity: we are complex creatures and need complex representations; (c) Spatiality and distribution: even within decision making; (d) Agency: awareness and the capacity to learn; (e) Communication: agents talk to one another. All would appear to be necessary for a successful model and most are difficult.",

            "abstract": "This paper presents and illustrates FlowLogo, an interactive modelling environment for developing coupled agent-based groundwater models (GW-ABMs). It allows users to simulate complex socio-environmental couplings in groundwater systems, and to explore how desirable patterns of groundwater and social development can emerge from agent behaviours and interactions. GW-ABMs can be developed using a single piece of software, addressing common issues around data transfer and model analyses that arise when linking ABMs to existing groundwater codes. FlowLogo is based on a 2D finite-difference solution of the governing groundwater flow equations and a set of procedures to represent the most common types of stresses and boundary conditions of regional aquifer flow. The platform is illustrated using a synthetic example of an expanding agricultural region that depends on groundwater for irrigation. The implementation and analysis of scenarios from this example highlight the possibility to: (i) deploy agents at multiple scales of decision-making (farmers, waterworks, institutions), (ii) model feedbacks between agent behaviours and groundwater dynamics, and (iii) perform sensitivity and multi-realisation analyses on social and physical factors. The FlowLogo interface allows interactively changing parameters using ’tuneable’ dials, which can adjust agent decisions and policy levers during simulations. This flexibility allows for live interaction with audiences (role-plays), in participatory workshops, public meetings, and as part of learning activities in classrooms. FlowLogo’s interactive features and ease of use aim to facilitate the wider dissemination and independent validation of GW-ABMs.",

However, and despite the emergence of many emotional models usable for simulations in the last few years, many modelers still tend to use too simple ad hoc emotional models. To support this view, this article proposes a survey of the different practices of modelers in terms of implementations of emotional models, as well as a presentation of different emotional architectures that already exist and that could be used by modelers. The main goal is to understand how emotions are used today in social simulations, in order for the community to unify its uses of emotional agents.",

            "abstract": "As agent-based modelling gains popularity, the demand for transparency in underlying modelling assumptions grows. Behavioural rules guiding agents’ decisions, learning, interactions and possible changes in these should rely on solid theoretical and empirical grounds. This field has matured enough to reach the point at which we need to go beyond just reporting what social theory we base these rules upon. Many social science theories operate with various abstract constructions such as attitudes, perceptions, norms or intentions. These concepts are rather subjective and remain open to interpretation when operationalizing them in a formal model code. There is a growing concern that how modellers interpret qualitative social science theories in quantitative ABMs may differ from case to case. Yet, formal tests of these differences are scarce and a systematic approach to analyse any possible disagreements is lacking. Our paper addresses this gap by exploring the consequences of variations in formalizations of one social science theory on the simulation outcomes of agent-based models of the same class. We ran simulations to test the impact of four differences: in model architecture concerning specific equations and their sequence within one theory, in factors affecting agents’ decisions, in representation of these potentially differing factors, and finally in the underlying distribution of data used in a model. We illustrate emergent outcomes of these differences using an agent-based model developed to study regional impacts of households’ solar panel investment decisions. The Theory of Planned Behaviour was applied as one of the most common social science theories used to define behavioural rules of individual agents. Our findings demonstrate qualitative and quantitative differences in simulation outcomes, even when agents’ decision rules are based on the same theory and data. The paper outlines a number of critical methodological implications for future developments in agent-based modelling.",

            "abstract": "Standards are as old as civilization itself and they are vital to human development. Standards touch almost every part of our lives, from the water we drink to the language used to write this article. A sign of a good standard is one that we do not notice. Good standards exist and so do processes and organizations to create and maintain them. As agent-based modeling and simulation matures as a methodology, a discussion of standards applicable to it becomes increasingly important. Descriptive standards for agent-based models, such as the Overview, Design concepts, and Details protocol and agent-based extensions to the Unified Modeling Language, have already begun to emerge. Software tools for implementing such models, such as Netlogo and Repast Simphony, are increasingly well-known and have the potential to become de facto standards among the wider scientific community for agent-based simulation. Based on the findings of a series of workshops that brought together experts throughout the modeling and simulation community, we argue that agent-based modeling and simulation is no different from the other emerging technical subjects in the sense that standards, both existing and new, may be applicable to it, and that the community should both adopt existing standards that are relevant and exploit the already existing standards processes and organizations to develop new ones.",

            "abstract": "Although the majority of researchers interested in ABM increasingly agree that the most natural way to program their models is to adopt OO practices, UML diagrams are still largely absent from their publications. In the last 15 years, the use of UML has risen constantly, to the point where UML has become the de facto standard for graphical visualization of software development. UML and its 13 diagrams has many universally accepted virtues. Most importantly, UML provides a level of abstraction higher than that offered by OO programming languages (Java, C++, Python,.Net...). This abstraction layer encourages researchers to spend more time on modeling rather than on programming. This paper initially presents the four most common UML diagrams - class, sequence, state and activity diagrams (based on my personal experience, these are the most useful diagrams for ABM development). The most important features of these diagrams are discussed, and explanations based on conceptual pieces often found in ABM models are given of how best to use the diagrams. Subsequently, some very well known and classical ABM models such as the Schelling segregation model, the spatial evolutionary game, and a continuous double action free market are subjected to more detailed UML analysis.",

            "abstract": "How one builds, checks, validates and interprets a model depends on its “purpose”. This is true even if the same model code is used for different purposes. This means that a model built for one purpose but then used for another needs to be re-justified for the new purpose and this will probably mean it also has to be rechecked, re-validated and maybe even re-built in a differentway. Herewe review some of the different purposes for a simulation model of complex social phenomena, focusing on seven in particular: prediction, explanation, description, theoretical exploration, illustration, analogy, and social interaction. The paper looks at some of the implications in terms of the ways in which the intended purpose might fail. This analysis motivates some of the ways in which these “dangers” might be avoided or mitigated. It also looks at the ways that a confusion of modelling purposes can fatally weaken modelling projects, whilst giving a false sense of their quality. These distinctions clarify some previous debates as to the best modelling strategy (e.g. KISS and KIDS). The paper ends with a plea for modellers to be clear concerning which purpose they are justifying their model against.",

However, realizing the full potential of ABMS to find breakthrough research results requires far greater computing capability than is available through current ABMS tools. The Repast for High Performance Computing (Repast HPC) project addresses this need by developing a useful and useable next-generation ABMS system explicitly focusing on larger-scale distributed computing platforms. Repast HPC is intended to smooth the path from small-scale simulations to large-scale distributed simulations through the use of a Logo-like system. This article’s contribution is its detailed presentation of the implementation of Repast HPC as a useful and usable framework, a complete ABMS platform developed explicitly for larger-scale distributed computing systems that leverages modern C++ techniques and the ReLogo language. © 2012, The Society for Modeling and Simulation International.

As a result, agent-based modelers have made only modest contributions to advancing organization theory and empirical research. In response, this study proposes critical realism as a philosophical perspective to understand and orient agent-based modeling research. A critical realist perspective clarifies the nature and purpose of agent-based modeling and indicates the potential complementarity between agent-based modeling and other approaches to theory building and testing in the field of management and organization studies. Key emphases within critical realism on mechanismic explanations, emergence, simplifying assumptions, and abductive reasoning support agent-based modelers’ practices. Critical realism carries implications for specifying models, clarifying ontology, evaluating model outcomes, validating models, triangulating, and identifying the limits of agent-based modeling. This study provides practical guidance from a critical realist perspective—to modelers and nonmodelers—to advance the contribution of agent-based modeling to management and organization research.",

            "abstract": "The term \"(social) mechanism\" is frequently encountered in the social science literature, but there is considerable confusion about the exact meaning of the term. The article begins by addressing the main conceptual issues. Use of this term is the hallmark of an approach that is critical of the explanatory deficits of correlational analysis and of the covering-law model, advocating instead the causal reconstruction of the processes that account for given macro-phenomena. The term \"social mechanisms\" should be used to refer to recurrent processes generating a specific kind of outcome. Explanation of social macro-phenomena by mechanisms typically involves causal regression to lower-level elements, as stipulated by methodological individualism. While there exist a good many mechanism models to explain emergent effects of collective behavior, we lack a similarly systematic treatment of generative mechanisms in which institutions and specific kinds of structural configurations play the decisive role.",

            "abstract": "Building mechanisms-based, black box-free explanations is the main goal of analytical sociology. In this article, I offer some reasons to question whether some of the conceptual and methodological developments of the analytical community really serve this goal. Specifically, I argue that grounding our computer modeling practices in the current definition of mechanisms posits a serious risk of defining an ideal-typical research path that neglects the role that the understanding of the generative process must have for a black box-free explanation to be met. I propose some conceptual and methodological alternatives, and I identify some collective challenges that the analytical community should tackle in order not to deviate from its main goal.",

            "abstract": "From the mid-20th century onwards, consolidated study of the merchant archives from the Old Assyrian trading colony at Kaneš (Kültepe) has not only transformed our understanding of the social, economic and political dynamics of the Bronze Age Near East, but also overturned many preconceived notions of what constitutes pre-modern trade. Despite this disciplinary impact and archaeological investigations at Kültepe and elsewhere, our understanding of this phenomenon has remained largely text-based and therefore of limited analytical scope, both spatially and contextually. This book re-assesses the Old-Assyrian trade network in Upper Mesopotamia and Central Anatolia during the Middle Bronze Age (c. 1970 – 1700 BC) by combining in some analytical detail the archaeology (e.g. material culture, settlement data, etc.) of the region both on its own terms and via a range of spatial approaches. The author offers a comparative and spatial perspective on exchange networks and economic strategies, continuity and discontinuity of specific trade circuits and routes, and the evolution of political landscapes throughout the Near East in the Middle Bronze Age.About the Author ALESSIO PALMISANO is a Post-Doctoral Research Associate at UCL Institute of Archaeology and is currently working on a research project examining the relationship between inferred regional demographic trends in the Mediterranean since the appearance of farming and reconstructed land cover in the past. His research so far has been primarily focused on the study of Western Asian and Eastern Mediterranean early complex societies, the analysis of settlement patterns, and the development of bespoke quantitative and computational methods to Archaeology. He also took part, with roles of scientific responsibility, in several campaigns of archaeological fieldwork, primarily in Iraq, Italy, Syria, and Turkey.",

            "abstract": "The environmental impacts caused by construction waste have attracted increasing attention in recent years. The effective management of construction waste is essential in order to reduce negative environmental influences. Construction waste management (CWM) can be viewed as a complex adaptive system, as it involves not only various factors (e.g., social, economic, and environmental), but also different stakeholders (such as developers, contractors, designers, and governmental departments) simultaneously. System dynamics (SD) and agent-based modeling (ABM) are the two most popular approaches to deal with the complexity in CWM systems. However, the two approaches have their own advantages and drawbacks. The aim of this research is to conduct a comprehensive review and develop a novel model for combining the advantages of both SD and ABM. The research findings revealed that two options can be considered when combining SD with ABM; the two options are discussed.",

            "abstract": "In this article it is argued that the search for “social mechanisms” is of crucial importance for the development of sociological theory. With this concept - which is occasionally used in the sociological literature but has received little systematic attention - attention is called to an intermediary level of analysis in-between pure description and story- telling, on the one hand, and universal social laws, on the other. While the search for universal laws and grand theory has a great deal of appeal, we do not believe that this type of theorizing is likely to foster the development of a useful body of explanatory theory. Drawing on the heritage of Robert Merton and James Coleman, it is argued that the essential aim of sociological theorizing should be to develop fine-grained middle-range theories that clearly explicate the social mechanisms that produce observed relationships between explanans and explanandum. We provide a tentative typology of social mechanisms, and we illustrate our argument by showing that three well-known theories in sociology- the self-fulfilling prophecy (Robert Merton), network diffusion (James Coleman), and threshold-based behavior (Mark Granovetter) - all are founded upon the same social mechanism. © 1996, Sage Publications.

            "abstract": "<p>There is a growing use of agent-based model (ABM) simulations to reconstruct past human-environment interactions. ABMs are useful in that they offer scientists the opportunity to model processes and study phenomena and systems that may not be otherwise reproducible or testable. Replication or re-implementation studies of ABMs are, however, infrequently undertaken, and there are few examples within archaeology or other social sciences. This paper documents the process of a successful ABM replication study, as well as two additional modifications to the original model. Results corroborate the findings of the original geoarchaeological model and indicate that episodic geomorphic events significantly affect archaeological deposit formation and the inferences drawn from associated radiocarbon records. One revision of the model further demonstrates that episodic fluvial events can create highly varied radiocarbon distributions. The second modification illustrates that excavation data helps to fill in hiatuses in radiocarbon chronologies on depositional landforms, although there is no effect across landscapes subject to erosion. This successful replication exercise also illustrates the value of Open Access data and analyses in reproducing, testing, and expanding upon archaeological research and theory building.</p>",

            "abstract": "Archaeologists make inferences about past human behaviour based on patterned material residues in various depositional contexts, including existing landsurfaces. These deposits are generated by processes that may obscure patterns at some observational scales while highlighting others, and interpretive differences can arise from a lack of explicit models of deposit formation. Here, an exploratory agent-based model based on the concept of the palimpsest is used to examine the effects of episodic sediment transport on the visibility and preservation of surface archaeological deposits in a fluvial context. Outcomes from the model indicate that the compound influences of preservation and visibility are capable of transforming a static radiocarbon record into one of increasing intensity towards the present, while simultaneously displaying periodic chronological gaps – features that have been used in our Australian study area to argue for demographic change driven by social or environmental factors. To differentiate between interpretations, expectations derived from the model are assessed against a second proxy from the same study area: Optically Stimulated Luminescence dates from hearth stones in surface contexts. Results indicate that patterns in the chronometric proxies from the study area are more consistent with episodic geomorphic change than explanations invoking changes in the local organization of human activity.",

            "abstract": "The availability of reliable commercial information is considered a key feature of inter-regional trade if the Roman economy was highly integrated. However, the extent to which archaeological and historical sources of inter-regional trade reflect the degree of economic integration is still not fully understood, a question which lies at the heart of current debates in Roman Studies. Ceramic tableware offers one of the only comparable and quantifiable sources of information for Roman inter-regional trade over centuries-long time periods. The distribution patterns and stylistic features of tablewares from the East Mediterranean dated between 200 BC and AD 300 suggest a competitive market where buying decisions might have been influenced by access to reliable commercial information. We contribute to this debate by representing three competing hypotheses in an agent-based model: success-biased social learning of tableware buying strategies (requiring access to reliable commercial information from all traders), unbiased social learning (requiring limited access), and independent learning (requiring no access). We use approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to evaluate which hypothesis best describes archaeologically observed tableware distribution patterns. Our results revealed success-bias is not a viable theory and we demonstrate instead that local innovation (independent learning) is a plausible driving factor in inter-regional tableware trade. We also suggest that tableware distribution should instead be explored as a small component of long-distance trade cargoes dominated by foodstuffs, metals, and building materials.",

            "abstract": "We report a study in which we systematically reviewed the recent literature dealing with human-environment interaction in prehistory. We first identified the 165 most highly cited papers published between 2005 and 2015. We then identified the major research themes covered in the sample of papers and assessed whether the themes fall into clusters and/or vary greatly in popularity. Subsequently, we identified potentially important lacunae. Our review identified dozens of themes and four major clusters: 1) improving our reconstructions of past environments; 2) the impact of climate change on past human societies; 3) human adaptation to past environmental conditions; and 4) human impacts on past environments. We also identified several gaps that led us to make a number of suggestions for future work. One is to pay more attention to the epistemology of causality. A second is to take into account nonlinearity when considering causal relationships. A third is to study the impact of chronological uncertainty on analyses. Lastly, our review revealed that there are differences between the aspects of human-environment interaction in prehistory that interest scholars and those that interest policy-makers and the general public. This needs to be addressed for obvious reasons.",

            "abstract": "The degree to which prehispanic societies in the northern upland Southwest were hierarchical or egalitarian is still debated and seems likely to have changed through time. This paper examines the plausibility of village-spanning polities in the northern Southwest by simulating the coevolution of hierarchy and warfare using extensions to the Village Ecodynamics Project’s agent-based model. We additionally compile empirical data on the population size distribution of habitations and ritual spaces (kivas) and the social groups that used them in three large regions of the Pueblo Southwest and analyze these through time. All lines of evidence refute an “autonomous village” model during the Pueblo II period (A.D. 890–1145); rather, they support the existence of village-spanning polities during the Pueblo II and probably into the Pueblo III period (A.D. 1145–1285) in some areas. One or more polities connecting the northern Southwest, with tribute flowing to an apex in Chaco Canyon, appears plausible during Pueblo II for the areas we examine. During Pueblo III, more local organizations likely held sway until depopulation in the late thirteenth century. , El grado de igualitarismo o jerarquización social en el seno de las sociedades prehispánicas del norte de las tierras altas del suroeste de Estados Unidos y los cambios de dicho aspecto a través del tiempo continúan siendo objeto de debate. Este trabajo examina la plausibilidad del surgimiento de sistemas de gobierno a nivel de villas múltiples en la región del Suroeste a través de simulaciones sobre la coevolución de la jerarquía y del conflicto utilizando una extensión de la modelización basada en agentes del proyecto Village Ecodynamics. Además, recopilamos datos empíricos sobre la distribución de los tamaños poblacionales en los lugares de habitación y los espacios rituales (kivas), y sobre los grupos sociales que las utilizaron, para tres de las mayores regiones del Suroeste norteamericano, analizando estos datos a través del tiempo. Todas evidencias refutan el modelo de villas autónomas durante el periodo Pueblo II (890–1145 d.C.). Al contrario, las evidencias sugieren el surgimiento de sistemas de gobierno a nivel de villas múltiples durante el periodo Pueblo II y probablemente durante el Pueblo III (1145–1285 d.C.) en algunas áreas. Parece plausible que durante el periodo Pueblo II, uno o más sistemas de gobierno conectaron la zona norte del suroeste de Estados Unidos mediante un sistema de tributos que fluyó hacia un epicentro situado en Chaco Canyon. Probablemente durante el periodo Pueblo III y hasta la despoblación de la región del final del siglo XIII, las organizaciones locales ganaron en influencia.",

Esta es una transición que implica un cierto cambio de paradigma, muy alineado con la investigación dirigida a retos sociales. Terra Incognita es resultado de la Red de Excelencia SimPastNet – Simular el pasado para entender el comportamiento humano (Redes de Excelencia 2017 I, HAR2017-90883-REDC). Esta red, coordinada por el Grupo de Ingeniería de Organización de la Universidad de Burgos (UBU), está formada por 10 grupos de investigación y 40 investigadores. Los integrantes de la red pertenecen tanto a grupos de investigación en Ciencias Sociales y Humanidades (Arqueología, Antropología y Sociología), como a grupos de investigación en Ciencias Formales (Matemáticas, Ingeniería e Informática). Todos ellos se caracterizan por su perspectiva transdisciplinar y presentan una larga experiencia de colaboración con especialistas de diferentes dominios. La Red SimPastNet surgió del proyecto de Investigación Consolider Ingenio SimulPast. Simulating the Past to Understand Human Behavior (MINECO – CSD2010-00034) un proyecto de Humanidades (fundamentalmente arqueológico), dirigido a promover el modelado y la simulación en la investigación histórica y, por tanto, con un marcado carácter innovador y transdisciplinar. A pesar de que Terra Incognita trate aspectos generales y ofrezca visiones de conjunto, esta genealogía explica el porqué de su perspectiva fundamentalmente anclada en las Ciencias Humanas y Sociales. Además, nos centraremos especialmente en el papel de las Humanidades y las Ciencias Sociales, porque constituyen una parte importante de esos ámbitos desde los que se están generando grandes aportaciones a esa transición que implica posicionarse en nuevos territorios, ajenos a las trayectorias históricas de nuestras disciplinas.",

Here we analyze the radiocarbon record of Iberia to reconstruct long-term changes in population levels and test different models of demographic growth during the Last Glacial-Interglacial transition. Our best fitting demographic model is composed of three phases. First, we document a regime of exponential population increase during the Late Glacial warming period (c.16.6-12.9 kya). Second, we identify a phase of sustained population contraction and stagnation, beginning with the cold episode of the Younger Dryas and continuing through the first half of the Early Holocene (12.9-10.2 kya). Finally, we report a third phase of density-dependent logistic growth (10.2-8 kya), with rapid population increase followed by stabilization. Our results support a population bottleneck hypothesis during the Last Glacial-Interglacial transition, providing a demographic context to interpret major shifts of prehistoric genetic groups in south-west Europe.",

            "abstract": "Agent-based modeling (ABM) involves developing models in which agents make adaptive decisions in a changing environment. Machine-learning (ML) based inference models can improve sequential decision-making by learning agents’ behavioral patterns. With the aid of ML, this emerging area can extend traditional agent-based schemes that hardcode agents’ behavioral rules into an adaptive model. Even though there are plenty of studies that apply ML in ABMs, the generalized applicable scenarios, frameworks, and procedures for implementations are not well addressed. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of applying ML in ABM based on four major scenarios, i.e., microagent-level situational awareness learning, microagent-level behavior intervention, macro-ABM-level emulator, and sequential decision-making. For these four scenarios, the related algorithms, frameworks, procedures of implementations, and multidisciplinary applications are thoroughly investigated. We also discuss how ML can improve prediction in ABMs by trading off the variance and bias and how ML can improve the sequential decision-making of microagent and macrolevel policymakers via a mechanism of reinforced behavioral intervention. At the end of this article, future perspectives of applying ML in ABMs are discussed with respect to data acquisition and quality issues, the possible solution of solving the convergence problem of reinforcement learning, interpretable ML applications, and bounded rationality of ABM.",

            "abstract": "The incongruity between the small and apparently impoverished Rapa Nui population that early European travelers encountered and the magnificence of its numerous and massive stone statues has fed a deep fascination with the island. Ethnographic and archaeological evidence suggest that the indigenous population was previously greater than the estimated 1,500–3,000 individuals observed by visitors in the eighteenth century. Our goal was to determine the maximum population that might have lived on the island by estimating its agricultural productivity in the time before European contact. To determine the agricultural potential of the island we sampled soils and established six weather stations in diverse contexts and recorded data over a 2-year period. We find that the island is wetter on average than previously believed. We also find that rainfall and temperature respond linearly to elevation, but a spatial model of precipitation requires correction for a rain shadow effect. We adapted to Rapa Nui an island-wide spatial model designed to identify agriculturally viable zones elsewhere in Polynesia. Based on functions relating climate and substrate age to measurements of soil base saturation, we identified 3,134 ha that were suitable for traditional dryland sweet potato cultivation, or about 19% of the 164 km2 island. We used a nutrient-cycling model to estimate yields. Modeled yields are highly sensitive to nitrogen (N) inputs and reliable estimates of these rates are unavailable, requiring us to bracket the rate of N inputs. In the case of low N availability, yields under continuous cultivation were very small, averaging 1.5 t/ha of wet sweet potato tuber. When the N fixation rate was quadrupled sustainable yields increased to 5.1 t/ha. In each N scenario we used a model of food-limited demography to examine the consequences of altering agricultural practices, the labor supply, the ability of the population to control its fertility, and the presence or absence of surplus production to support social inequalities. In the low-N case viable populations average approximately 3,500 individuals across all parameter combinations, vs. 17,500 in the high-N case, although sustainable populations in excess of 25,000 were possible under some assumptions.",

            "abstract": "Following on the work of Dunnell, the evolutionary archaeology school has made a sharp distinction between functional and stylistic variation in archaeological artifacts. Variation is defined as functional if it is affected by selection processes and as stylistic if it is a result of processes of random drift. The argument has been further developed by Neiman (1995), who showed by simulation that processes of cultural mutation and drift could produce the kinds of \"battleship curves\" that generally characterize artifact-style frequency distributions through time, and also demonstrated that they could account for patterns of stylistic variation through time in Woodland-period ceramic assemblages from Illinois. In this paper we present a case study of change in the decoration of pottery from early Neolithic Central Europe. We show that the actual diachronic frequency distributions and those expected under the neutral model do not coincide and conclude that in this case the neutral model does not provide an adequate description of change in ceramic decoration. A model involving selection, in the form of a bias in favor of novelty in the later phases of the period studied, seems likely to be more appropriate, and we note the social interpretation of the original investigator of the data. In conclusion, it is suggested that neutral models provide an important heuristic tool but that there is not a radical break between functional and stylistic variation. , Résumé Siguiendo a Dunnell, la escuela de “arqueología evolucionista” ha profesado una clara distinción entre la variatión funcional y la variación estilística de los artefactos arqueológicos. Se puede definir variación como funcional si ésta es afectada porprocesos de selectión y como estilística si es el resultado de procesos de deriva aleatoria. Este argumento ha sido desarrollado en mayor detalle por Neiman (1995), quien demostró por medio de estudios de simulatión que los procesos de mutatión y deriva producen los tipos de curvas en forma de “barcos de batalla ” que generalmente caracterizan la distributión de estilos del artefacto y quién además demostró que estos procesos explican los patrones de variación estilística de los conjuntos cerámicos del período Woodland en Illinois. En este ensayo nosotros presentamos un ejemplo del cambio de la decoratión en la cerámica del Neolitico temprano de Europa Central. Demostramos que las distribuciones de frecuencias actuates diacrónicas así como las esperadas en el modelo neutral sencillamente no proveen una explicacación adecuada de los cambios de decoración en la cerámica. Antes bien, proponemos que es más probable que la explicatión resida en un modelo de selectión, el cual favorece innovatión hacia las fases finales del período bajo consideratión tomando además en cuenta la interpretatión social que el investigador original extrajo de los datos. En conclusión sugerimos que los modelos explicativos neutros nos proporcionan una importante herramienta heurística pew que, a su vez, hay una separatión radical entre la variatión funcional y la estilística.",

            "abstract": "Agent based modelling is a simulation method in which autonomous agents interact with their environment and one another, given a predefined set of rules. It is an integral method for modelling and simulating complex systems, such as socio-economic problems. Since agent based models are not described by simple and concise mathematical equations, code that generates them is typically complicated, large, and slow. Here we present Agents.jl, a Julia-based software that provides an ABM analysis platform with minimal code complexity. We compare our software with some of the most popular ABM software in other programming languages. We find that Agents.jl is not only the most performant, but also the least complicated software, providing the same (and sometimes more) features as the competitors with less input required from the user. Agents.jl also integrates excellently with the entire Julia ecosystem, including interactive applications, differential equations, parameter optimization, and more. This removes any “extensions library” requirement from Agents.jl, which is paramount in many other tools.",

            "abstract": "Cognitive science increasingly strives to avoid the gratuitous assumption that minds “represent” a world. For Anthony Chemero, a radical and embodied approach hypothesizes that agent–environment interactions ground all cognitive powers. Pursuing this bold view, the paper shows how agent-based modeling (ABM) can clarify how cultural resources (e.g., sound patterns) enable flexible adaptive behavior. They grant communities modes of action that arise as bodies sensitize to coordinated behavior (e.g. how /a/ is spoken). Using ABM, Stanford and Kenny (Language Variation and Change, 25(02), 119–153, 2013) examine pronunciation shifts. They show how future changes can be prefigured in simple child-agents: this pinpoints the premature theorization that all too often bedevils the human sciences. Given significant differences in how /a/ is pronounced, many mistakenly conclude that there must be an “underlying” (neural) mechanism. They ignore the diachronic nature of human cognition—much depends on history. Those who immediately posit inner mechanisms stumble into the e-bar () fallacy: they assume that an intervening variable (or system) must explain any significant difference. ABM is thus a deflationary weapon to investigate cognition beyond the brain. Pursuing the positive agenda, I echo Robert Rosen in stressing that biological encoding is creative: models can show how social norms empower diachronic systems. While based in embrained bodies, humans depend on ascribing sense to events in cognitive cultural ecosystems. As living beings, persons use artifacts, institutions and the said—they exploit impersonal resources. A major advantage of ABM is that it can be used to model how such resources enrich body-based cognition.",

Social and asocial agency in agent-based systems depends on the conceptual engineering performed by computer scientists and application engineers. The perspective of multidimensional, gradual agency allows both agency (potentiality) and action (actuality) in socio-technical systems to be examined. A conceptual framework is presented which permits the phenomena of complex regulation of behavior and execution control in computer-mediated environments to be characterized. On this basis scenarios in which humans and non-human agents interact can be analyzed. Emergence in such systems may be described. Distributed action in the material reality can be compared to test-bed simulations. It is shown how the exploration of social and asocial agency in virtual environments may profit from work done in machine ethics.",

            "abstract": "This chapter overviews existing applications of agent-based modeling (ABMg) in organization science, pointing to possible cross-contaminations of these research fields. The reviewed applications include the garbage can model of organizational choice, the usage of cellular automata and of the NK model in order to investigate various problems of organizational interdependencies, and realistic agent-based models of agile productive plants. Possible future applications may include employing unsupervised neural networks in applied research on organizational routines, as well as employing sophisticated models of organizational evolution in order to understand such neglected features as punctuated equilibria and exaptation. Given the scope of the research agendas that ABMg can provide, it is quite surprising that this tool has been largely ignored by organization science hitherto. One possible explanation is that ABMg, which presents itself as a computational technique, inadvertently conceives its very nature of a tool for the exploration of novel research hypotheses. It is eventually perceived by non-practitioners as one more statistical technique for the validation of given hypotheses, and possibly a needlessly complex one.",

Simon, who suggested individuals depend on opinions, recommendations, information, and advice coming from other human beings and labeled it “docility.” Limited attention has been devoted to the study of this key characteristic of decision makers. This chapter takes the original model of docility, expands it, and applies it to individuals in structured or formal social systems (e.g., organizations). This exercise is performed using agent-based modeling and it explores under what circumstances organizational “docility” is supported or not.",

Suppose to have a large number of agents belonging to a finite number of different groups: as the agents randomly interact with each other, they move from a group to another as a result of the interaction. The object of interest is the stochastic process describing the number of agents in each group. As this is generally intractable, it has been proposed in the literature to approximate it in several ways. We review these approximations and we illustrate them with reference to a version of the epidemic model. The tools presented in the paper should be considered as a complement rather than as a substitute of the classical analysis of ABMs through simulation.",

A number of research projects have dealt with this topic, and some of the results and experiences gathered in participating in two recent projects are presented in this paper. The main assertion of the paper is motivated by the finding that in order to be reproducibly successful with creating agent-based models from textual evidence, the development process needs to involve conceptual modelling in a well-structured way. This becomes more important if stakeholders should be taken along the modelling, and if due to the amount and kind of evidence to be regarded, appropriate analysis techniques have to be used. This paper aims to give some guidelines on how such an approach could be designed, which has been successfully applied in the realisation of a model about the collapse of a criminal network-from the initial preparation of raw texts, through text analysis, conceptual and formal modelling, right up to the final presentation of simulation results.",

This study investigates team decision processes by using an agent-based model to conceptualize team decisions as an emergent property. It uses a mixed-method research design with a laboratory experiment providing qualitative and quantitative input for the model’s construction, as well as data for an output validation of the model. First, the laboratory experiment generates data about individual and team cognition structures. Then, the agent-based model is used as a computational testbed to contrast several processes of team decision making, representing potential, simplified mechanisms of how a team decision emerges. The increasing overall fit of the simulation and empirical results indicates that the modeled decision processes can at least partly explain the observed team decisions. Overall, we contribute to the current literature by presenting an innovative mixed-method approach that opens and exposes the black box of team decision processes beyond well-known static attributes.",

While there has been much attention to studying systemic changes primarily in ecology as well as in economics, the attempts to do so for coupled socio-environmental systems are rarer. This paper bridges the gap by reviewing how models can be instrumental in exploring significant, fundamental changes in such systems. The history of modelling systemic change in various disciplines contains a range of definitions and approaches. Even so, most of these efforts share some common challenges within the modelling context. We propose a framework drawing these challenges together, and use it to discuss the articles in this thematic issue on modelling systemic change in coupled social and environmental systems. The differing approaches used highlight that modelling systemic change is an area of endeavour that would benefit from greater synergies between the various disciplines concerned with systemic change.",

The complex properties of such systems make modelling an indispensable tool for their description and analysis. Human actors play a pivotal role in SESs, but their interactions with each other and their environment are often underrepresented in SES modelling. We argue that more attention should be given to social aspects in models of SESs, but this entails additional kinds of complexity. Modelling choices need to be as transparent as possible, and to be based on analysis of the purposes and limitations of modelling. We recommend thinking in terms of modelling projects rather than single models. Such a project may involve multiple models adopting different modelling methods. We argue that agent-based models (ABMs) are an essential tool in an SES modelling project, but their expressivity, which is their major advantage, also produces problems with model transparency and validation. We propose the use of formal ontologies to make the structure and meaning of models as explicit as possible, facilitating model design, implementation, assessment, comparison and extension.",

            "abstract": "Despite the critical role that replication plays in the advancement of science, its presence in modelling literature is rare. To encourage others to conduct replication and report success and challenges that facilitate or hinder replication, we present the replication of an agent-based model (ABM) of residential sprawl using the Replication Standard. Replication results achieved relational equivalence. Through the replication process, issues with the original research were identified and corrected in an Improved model, which qualitatively supported original results. A specific challenge affecting alignment of original and Replicate models included capturing model output variability and publishing all original output data for statistical analysis. Through the replication of agent-based models, additional confidence in model behaviour can be garnered and replicated ABMs can become accredited for reuse by others. Future research in the development and refinement of replication methodology and assessments should be cultivated along with a culture of value for replication efforts.",

In this manuscript, we assess code sharing and model documentation practices of 7500 publications about individual-based and agent-based models. The code availability increased over the years, up to 18% in 2018. Model documentation does not include all the elements that could improve the transparency of the models, such as mathematical equations, flow charts, and pseudocode. We find that articles with equations and flow charts being cited more among other model papers, probably because the model documentation is more transparent. The practices of code sharing improve slowly over time, partly due to the emergence of more public repositories and archives, and code availability requirements by journals and sponsors. However, a significant change in norms and habits need to happen before computational modeling becomes a reproducible science.",

Thus, in the final week of the 2013 fall semester, Wofford College’s undergraduate Modeling and Simulation for the Sciences course (COSC/MATH 201) considered ABM using the NetLogo tool. The students explored existing ABMs and completed two tutorials that developed models on unconstrained growth and the average distance covered by a random walker. The models demonstrated some of the utility of ABM and helped illustrate the similarities and differences between agent-based modeling and previously discussed techniques— system dynamics modeling, empirical modeling, and cellular automaton simulations. Improved test scores and questionnaire results support the success of the goals for the week.",

            "abstract": "Evolutionary game theory is a successful mathematical framework geared towards understanding the selective pressures that affect the evolution of the strategies of agents engaged in interactions with potential conflicts. While a mathematical treatment of the costs and benefits of decisions can predict the optimal strategy in simple settings, more realistic settings such as finite populations, non-vanishing mutations rates, stochastic decisions, communication between agents, and spatial interactions, require agent-based methods where each agent is modeled as an individual, carries its own genes that determine its decisions, and where the evolutionary outcome can only be ascertained by evolving the population of agents forward in time. While highlighting standard mathematical results, we compare those to agent-based methods that can go beyond the limitations of equations and simulate the complexity of heterogeneous populations and an ever-changing set of interactors. We conclude that agent-based methods can predict evolutionary outcomes where purely mathematical treatments cannot tread (for example in the weak selection–strong mutation limit), but that mathematics is crucial to validate the computational simulations.",

            "abstract": "The concepts of information transfer and causal effect have received much recent attention, yet often the two are not appropriately distinguished and certain measures have been suggested to be suitable for both. We discuss two existing measures, transfer entropy and information flow, which can be used separately to quantify information transfer and causal information flow respectively. We apply these measures to cellular automata on a local scale in space and time, in order to explicitly contrast them and emphasize the differences between information transfer and causality. We also describe the manner in which the measures are complementary, including the conditions under which they in fact converge. We show that causal information flow is a primary tool to describe the causal structure of a system, while information transfer can then be used to describe the emergent computation on that causal structure.",

This makes the validation of such models challenging, especially when explanations apply to wide geographical or chronological contexts, such as the transition to agriculture across Europe. Computational modeling allows for the formalization and testing of conceptual models while allowing other researchers to replicate that research. The formalization and open availability of such models is critical for a better understanding of this transition and large-scale complex processes in the past. We review successful attempts to use computational modeling in archaeology and outline the benefits of using computational models to understand the past.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this work is to explore hitchhiking as the main process responsible for the diversity of cultural items in the Western Mediterranean in the context of the spread of agriculture during the Neolithic (8000 to 7200 cal BP). The use of hitchhiking in a cultural context is defined as the transmission of neutral traits (e.g. linguistics) with variants that offer some advantage (i.e. political systems). In this research, a cellular automaton model is applied. Its purpose is to simulate the dispersal of the Neolithic and its cultural consequences based on the selection of cultural traits via hitchhiking phenomenon. The results of this work suggest that markers of cultural hitchhiking can be identified during the early Neolithic in the Western Mediterranean.",

            "abstract": "Archaeological and paleoecological studies demonstrate that human-caused fires have long-term influences on terrestrial and atmospheric systems, including the transformation of “wild” landscapes into managed, agricultural landscapes. Throughout Europe, the emergence of Neolithic land use likely contributed to broad-scale alterations of fire regimes, resulting in changes in vegetation community composition and distribution. However, mismatches between archaeological data on early agropastoral practices and paleoecological data on fire history and vegetation change make the relationship between Neolithic farmers and landscape change difficult to interpret. Computational modeling offers a new approach to anthropogenic fire that links social and biophysical processes in a “virtual laboratory” where long-term scenarios can be simulated and then compared with empirical data. This chapter applies the Charcoal Record Simulation Model (CharRec) to empirical, sedimentary charcoal records from three study areas in eastern Spain and evaluates how Neolithic agropastoral burning practices, including fire spatial distribution, frequency, size, and intensity, may have influenced fire regimes during the Holocene. With the emerging interest in tracing the prehistoric roots of the Anthropocene, computational models in archaeology are increasingly important in answering the difficult and often tangled questions regarding the feedbacks between humans and their environments in long-term social ecological systems.",

We construct differential equations representing two competing populations that spread by a diffusion process across an area representing the Great Basin. The demographic variables are fixed to agree with ethnographic data, while the migration rates are fitted to the estimated time for the completion of the spread. The model predicts a spatial distribution of the Numic languages in satisfactory agreement with observations and suggests new avenues of investigation. , Resumen En el presente artículo desarrollamos un modelo matemático de la dispersión de pueblos de habla Numic en la Great Basin durante el segundo milenio A.D. El modelo se basa en las ideas de Bettinger y Baumhoff (1982), quienes proponen una interactión competitiva entrepueblos Numic y Prenumic en la región. Utilizamos ecuaciones diferenciales para representar la migración de las poblaciones mediante un proceso de difusión en un área equivalente a la Great Basin. Las variables demográficas se determinaron en base a datos etnográficos, en tanto que los índices de migratión se ajustan al tiempo requerido para completar la dipersión. El modelo predice una distribución espacial de las lenguas Numic que coincide satisfactoriamente con las observaciones y sugiere nuevas líneas de investigación.",

Games offer engaging environments that can help generating insights into social dynamics, perceptions, and behaviours, while ABMs support the representation and analysis of complexity. We present here the first attempt to “discipline” the interdisciplinary endeavour of developing a GAM design in which an ABM is transformed into a game, thus the two becoming intertwined in one application. When doing this, we use as a GAM design exemplar the process of developing Quantum Leaper, a proof-of-concept video game made in Unity software and based on the NetLogo implementation of the well known “Artificial Anasazi” ABM. This study aims to consolidate the methodology component of the GAM field by proposing the GAM Reflection Framework, a tool that can be used by GAM practitioners, ABM modellers, or game designers looking for methodological guidance with developing an agent-based model that is a game (i.e. an agent-based game).",

Agent-based models are capable of integrating diverse causal relationships into coherent causal mechanisms. They mirror the crucial, multi-level component of emergent phenomena and recognize the important role of single-level causes without limiting the scope of the offered explana- tion. Implementing various types of causal relationships to complement the generative causation offers insight into how a multi-level phenomenon happens and allows for building more complete causal explanations. The capacity to work with multiple approaches to causality is crucial when tackling the complex problems of the modern world.",

            "abstract": "Across the natural and social world, some fairly advanced and apparently robust systems destroy themselves without discernible reason, function, or purpose. Whereas such and similar cases have been discussed within specific branches of scholarships, the attempts to propose and test a general theory of self-destruction in complex systems remain, to our knowledge, a thing of the future. To move in this direction, we suggest that the conflicts between explicit stratification, thorough functional differentiation and tacit segmentation within complex systems, are likely to provoke their unintended self-annihilation. Furthermore, we hypothesize that whenever such systems collapse, it is the circular co-dependency of noisy signaling, redundancy, and semantic inflation that sets self-destructive mechanisms in motion. We illustrate our preliminary findings with examples from social, natural, and artificial life; reexamine autoimmunity as a popular model of systemic self-destruction; and indicate potential avenues of empirical research aimed at supporting, qualifying or disproving the underlying hypothesis.",

            "abstract": "This chapter examines the concept of causal inference; discusses the concept of causality; and aims to investigate the concept of mechanism. Thus, various forms of regression analysis became the main tools to establish causal claim, and statistical inference was silently equated to causal inference. Goldthorpe observed that the views on causality combine in practice with distinctive methods of social inquiry. The association between specific methods for causal inference and views on causation—an association recently also documented by Kaidesoja—is especially visible in the recent and flourishing literature on the so-called ’potential outcome’ approach. Recent sociological scholarship shows that the bone of contention is the opposition between the vertical and horizontal view of mechanisms that was behind the Hauser–Boudon debate. The analysis of the variety of accounts that the concepts of causality and mechanism have received clearly suggests that the different intuitions on the two notions connect in a systematic way.",

It focuses on an ABM’s intrinsic technical potentialities. Within ABMs, the amount, and the type, of heterogeneity to be assumed becomes a modeling problem itself, and the implications at a higher level of analysis of the choices made at a given level of analysis in terms of heterogeneity can be deductively studied in a systematic way. Contrary to the association that some—usually unfamiliar with the field—tend to establish between ABMs and rational-choice theorizing, the tool is entirely agnostic on the kind of micro-foundations a modeler should subscribe to. Among statistically minded social scientists, those who exploited object-oriented programming to create new statistical methods and/or software packages also tend to recognize an ABM’s interest for causal inference.",

It focuses on the basis of a meta-analysis of a selection of models from several disciplines, develops a typology of ABMs that clarifies that, within the general trend of increasing ABM realism, “theoretical”, “input”, and “outcome” realism often vary independently within a given ABM. Arguably, that highly stylized ABMs are much more frequent than data-driven models is related to how the ABM was framed by the first programmatic work aiming to introduce this method into the social sciences. The strong impact that the Keep It Simple, Stupid principle had on ABMs is testified by the fact that even ABMs seeking to go beyond ’toy models’ may score very low on ’theoretical realism’. In sociology, ABMs with similar features can also be found.",

It discusses from-within-the-method solutions to circumvent such limitations. ’Theoretically informed’ ABMs constitute a first improvement. The ’input realism’ of an ABM can be increased through ’empirical calibration’. The major difficulty with empirical calibration and validation of an ABM comes from data availability. The ABM’s granularity and the requirement of empirical embeddedness to increase ABMs’ input and output realism push in opposite directions. Sensitivity analysis can be performed in different ways. If sensitivity analysis focuses on the values of an ABM’s parameters, robustness analysis is directed to the ABM’s ’internal’ cogs and wheels and aims at assessing how varying these cogs and wheels impacts on the ABM’s outcomes.",

It argues that, in fact, the use of statistical models for causal inference is itself more controversial than it may seem at first. The chapter systematically scrutinizes randomized control trials, instrumental variables, and directed acyclic graphs more specifically with respect to assumptions that cannot be tested in practice because of data availability, assumptions that are untestable in principle because they would require infinite knowledge capabilities, and how reliability is established in practice within these methods. It discusses putative fundamental differences between ABMs and experimental/observational methods.",

It shows why it would be profitable to shift the debate from defending the superiority of particular methods, and thus of specific understandings of causality and mechanism, to discussing how agent-based models, experiments and observational methods can provide a variety of evidential sources that compensate for each other’s weaknesses. In particular, the truth of the causal claim is inferred, because it provides the best explanation of the data among a pool of alternative hypotheses, by either being directly supported by data and arguments, or by being indirectly supported by data and arguments that rule out the alternatives. The network of ties between agents representing sexual partnerships was empirically calibrated on the basis of the observed annual number of partners, and so was the number of monthly sexual acts.",

            "abstract": "Agent-based modelling (ABM) has been used to study the dynamics of complex systems, including human societies. However, the design of such models often fails to capture one of the key features of human behavior: norms. While norms and normative behavior are extensively studied in artificial intelligence (AI), especially in the context of multi-agent systems (MAS), their approaches are often very complex and formalized, going against the prevailing discourse of ABM, which advocates keeping the models as simple as possible and pruning any unnecessary complexity. Nevertheless, norms are relevant and integral to many social contexts, and capturing their effect and dynamics often requires agents that, while not as complex as those developed for AI, are capable of sophisticated cognition. We present a normative architecture that attempts to capture the ways norms affect cognition and behavior, while at the same time being lightweight enough to be suitable for ABM use in simulations.",

            "abstract": "Simulations of spatial interaction in archaeology have been successful in predicting the emergence of central sites, and political and economic hierarchies that match observed long-term settlement patterns. It still remains unclear, however, to what degree such models can effectively allow for uncertainty in the archaeological record, especially when it comes to incomplete and unevenly distributed settlement data, and how best they might incorporate artefact-scale evidence. This paper aims to address these issues, while attempting to tackle widely debated aspects of socio-political organisation and cultural interaction in the prehistoric Cretan landscape at the period immediately before and after the foundation of the first palace of Phaistos, one of the less well documented Bronze Age phases. We employ a simulation of spatial interaction inspired by approaches first developed in urban geography and combine this with regression-based predictive modelling to address the uncertainty introduced by missing settlements. We use evidence from artefact analysis partly to calibrate and partly to validate our model. We conclude that such an approach can contribute to more convincing archaeological theories about socio-political organisation, cultural affinity and regional identity by providing new evidence even in the presence of very fragmented data.",

            "abstract": "Thus, with a literary flourish and a dash of popular folklore, Postan implies that the difference between history and physics is not intrinsic to the subject matter, but the question posed of it. Provocatively put, this is an extremely tendentious point of view. Apples are mindless. On the other hand, people are not just minds and history is not merely the history of ideas. Human life is rich and complex, and to catch and illuminate its many dimensions many approaches are necessary. These approaches are, in the broadest sense, disciplinary: anthropology, archaeology, geography, history and sociology all have as their subject people and society. Their concurrence is apparent in, for example, ethnoarchaeology (see e.g. Binford 1983, and for anthropology and ancient history, Humphreys 1978), geoarchaeology (e.g. Butzer 1982), historical geography (e.g. Carlstein et al. 1978; Pred 1981), historical sociology (e.g. Giddens 1981; Abrams 1982; Skocpol 1984), and the Annalestradition (e.g. Febvre 1922). In this paper we bring together history and geography in a new and exciting way.",

Agent-based modeling in turn advances complexity science by actuating many complex system characteristics, such as self-organization, nonlinearity, sensitivity, and resilience. There are many points of contact between complexity and agent-based modeling, and we examine several of particular importance: the range of complexity approaches; tensions between theoretical and empirical research; calibration, verification, and validation; scale; equilibrium and change; and decision making. These issues, together and separately, comprise some of the key issues found at the interface of complexity research and agent-based modeling.",

            "abstract": "Behavioral ecologists combine evolutionary models of mechanism and ecological models of circumstance to analyze the origins and forms of intragroup exchange among social foragers, a category that includes primates, hominids, and recent and modern hunter-gatherers. Evolutionary mechanisms encompass individual, sexual, reciprocal, kin, group, and cultural selection; models of circumstance include tolerated theft, scrounging, marginal value, trade, show-offs, and risk reduction. After a critical review, I develop a partial synthesis of these models. The results show that exchange behaviors have multicausal origins and they likely will be diverse due to differing combinations of mechanism and circumstance. They also help explain seemingly unique features of foraging economies, including constrained production and routine demand sharing.",

            "abstract": "Agent-based modelling (ABM) has become an established methodology in many areas of biology, ranging from the cellular to the ecological population and community levels. In plant science, two different scales have predominated in their use of ABM. One is the scale of populations and communities, through the modelling of collections of agents representing individual plants, interacting with each other and with the environment. The other is the scale of the individual plant, through the modelling, by functional–structural plant models (FSPMs), of agents representing plant building blocks, or metamers, to describe the development of plant architecture and functions within individual plants. The purpose of this review is to show key results and parallels in ABM for growth, mortality, carbon allocation, competition and reproduction across the scales from the plant organ to populations and communities on a range of spatial scales to the whole landscape. Several areas of application of ABMs are reviewed, showing that some issues are addressed by both population-level ABMs and FSPMs. Continued increase in the relevance of ABM to environmental science and management will be helped by greater integration of ABMs across these two scales.",

For the coast-hugging populations of the ancient Mediterranean, mobility and exchange depended on a distinct environment and technological parameters that created diverse challenges and opportunities, making the modeling of maritime interaction a paramount concern for understanding cultural interaction more generally. Network-inspired metaphors have long been employed in discussions of this interaction, but increasing theoretical sophistication and advances in formal network analysis now offer opportunities to refine and test the dominant paradigm of connectivity. Extending from prehistory into the Byzantine period, the case studies here reveal the potential of such network approaches. Collectively they explore the social, economic, religious, and political structures that guided Mediterranean interaction across maritime space.",

To do this in a structured way, we review the main concepts of the methodology (e.g. we provide precise definitions for the terms “error” and “artefact”) and establish a general framework that summarises the process of designing, implementing, and using agent-based models. Within this framework we identify the various stages where different types of assumptions are usually made and, consequently, where different types of errors and artefacts may appear. We then propose several activities that can be conducted to detect each type of error and artefact.",

            "abstract": "Agent-based Models and Causal Inference Scholars of causal inference have given little credence to the possibility that ABMs could be an important tool in warranting causal claims. Manzo’s book makes a convincing case that this is a mistake. The book starts by describing the impressive progress that ABMs have made as a credible methodology in the last several decades. It then goes on to compare the inferential threats to ABMs versus the traditional methods of RCTs, regression, and instrumental variables showing that they have a common vulnerability of being based on untestable assumptions. The book concludes by looking at four examples where an analysis based on ABMs complements and augments the evidence for specific causal claims provided by other methods. Manzo has done a most convincing job of showing that ABMs can be an important resource in any researcher’s tool kit.Christopher Winship, Diker-Tishman Professor of Sociology, Harvard University, USA Agent-based Models and Causal Inference is a first-rate contribution to the debate on, and practice of, causal claims. With exemplary rigor, systematic precision and pedagogic clarity, this book contrasts the assumptions about causality that undergird agent-based models, experimental methods, and statistically based observational methods, discusses the challenges these methods face as far as inferences go, and, in light of this discussion, elaborates the case for combining these methods’ respective strengths: a remarkable achievement. Ivan Ermakoff, Professor of Sociology, University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA Agent-based models are a uniquely powerful tool for understanding how patterns in society may arise in often surprising and counter-intuitive ways. This book offers a strong and deeply reflected argument for how ABM’s can do much more: add to actual empirical explanation. The work is of great value to all social scientists interested in learning how computational modelling can help unraveling the complexity of the real social world. Andreas Flache, Professor of Sociology at the University of Groningen, Netherlands Agent-based Models and Causal Inference is an important and much-needed contribution to sociology and computational social science. The book provides a rigorous new contribution to current understandings of the foundation of causal inference and justification in the social sciences. It provides a powerful and cogent alternative to standard statistical causal-modeling approaches to causation. Especially valuable is Manzo’s careful analysis of the conditions under which an agent-based simulation is relevant to causal inference. The book represents an exceptional contribution to sociology, the philosophy of social science, and the epistemology of simulations and models. Daniel Little, Professor of philosophy, University of Michigan, USA Agent-based Models and Causal Inference delivers an insightful investigation into the conditions under which different quantitative methods can legitimately hold to be able to establish causal claims. The book compares agent-based computational methods with randomized experiments, instrumental variables, and various types of causal graphs. Organized in two parts, Agent-based Models and Causal Inference connects the literature from various fields, including causality, social mechanisms, statistical and experimental methods for causal inference, and agent-based computation models to help show that causality means different things within different methods for causal analysis, and that persuasive causal claims can only be built at the intersection of these various methods. Readers will also benefit from the inclusion of: A thorough comparison between agent-based computation models to randomized experiments, instrumental variables, and several types of causal graphs A compelling argument that observational and experimental methods are not qualitatively superior to simulation-based methods in their ability to establish causal claims Practical discussions of how statistical, experimental and computational methods can be combined to produce reliable causal inferences Perfect for academic social scientists and scholars in the fields of computational social science, philosophy, statistics, experimental design, and ecology, Agent-based Models and Causal Inference will also earn a place in the libraries of PhD students seeking a one-stop reference on the issue of causal inference in agent-based computational models.",

This is certainly the case for the subject of this book, originally published in 1994, which explores the contribution that computer-based modelling and artificial intelligence can make to understanding fundamental issues in social science. Simulating Societies shows how computer simulations can help to clarify theoretical approaches, contribute to the evaluation of alternative theories, and illuminate one of the major issues of the social sciences: how social phenomena can \"emerge\" from individual action. The authors discuss how simulation models can be constructed using recently developed artificial intelligence techniques and they consider the methodological issues involved in using such models for theory development, testing and experiment. The introductory chapters situate the book within social science, and suggest why the time was ripe for significant progress, before defining basic terminology, showing how simulation has been used to theorize about organizations, and indicating through examples some of the fundamental issues involved in simulation. The main body of the text provides case studies drawn from economics, anthropology, archaeology, planning, social psychology and sociology. The appeal of this path-breaking book was twofold. It offered an essential introduction to simulation for social scientists and it provided case study applications for computer scientists interested in the latest advances in the burgeoning area of distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) at the time.",

            "abstract": "Written by one of the preeminent researchers in the field, this book provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the relationships between causal connections and statistical associations. The book will open the way for including causal analysis in the standard curricula of statistics, artificial intelligence, business, epidemiology, social sciences, and economics. Students in these fields will find natural models, simple inferential procedures, and precise mathematical definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have evaded or made unduly complicated. The first edition of Causality has led to a paradigmatic change in the way that causality is treated in statistics, philosophy, computer science, social science, and economics. Cited in more than 5,000 scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers readers’ questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent advances in this field of research. Causality will be of interests to students and professionals in a wide variety of fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating and invaluable.",

            "abstract": "This article introduces microsimulation by presenting its main underlying ideas as well as its main strengths and drawbacks. Microsimulation is currently experiencing a boom, which is driven by three main forces. The first is the increased demand of policy makers for detailed projections and models able to assess distributional and long-term sustainability issues of social security systems. The second is the emergence of new research paradigms with an increased emphasis on individuals within their context, studied from a longitudinal, multilevel perspective. The third concerns technological advances, providing not only the necessary computer power but also the programming tools for model development, accessible to scientists without specialized programming skills. Although static microsimulation models are established tools for policy analysis, dynamic microsimulation has yet to find its way into the methodological toolbox of mainstream social scientists—but the prospects are promising.",

            "abstract": "Active innovation resistance is considered to be a main driver of innovation rejection, and traditionally related to five product-specific adoption barriers driving this negative attitude formation. While recent literature introduced a more comprehensive typology encompassing nine functional and eight psychological barriers driving active innovation resistance, an empirical validation of this framework is still missing. In order to close this research gap, we employed a two-study design. First, we conducted a qualitative study to empirically evaluate whether the typology including 17 adoption barriers encompasses all possible negative, product driven reactions of consumers within new product evaluations. Second, we used a quantitative large-scale study to assess the relative importance of each single product-specific adoption barrier within new product evaluations in the context of product and mobile service innovation. Both studies confirm that innovations are commonly rejected owing to these 17 product-specific adoption barriers. However, our results also highlight that functional and psychological barriers vary in their effect on adoption intention depending on whether a new product or service gets evaluated. This study provides first empirical evidence in favor of applying a more comprehensive typology of product-specific barriers when assessing effects of active innovation resistance on consumers’ adoption behavior in future research.",

Accordingly, this study proposes and tests a framework of the effect of technological innovation on the psychological well-being of employees and how much effect is shaped by employee learning orientation and perceived organizational support. Empirical findings from 202 employees within 40 manufacturing SMEs show an inverted U-shaped relationship between technological innovation and employee psychological well-being (measured as employee anxiety and satisfaction). Further analysis reveals that both employee learning orientation and perceived organization support enhance the inverted U-shaped effect of technological innovation on employee psychological well-being. Our findings present important research and practical implications for innovation and organizational studies literature.",

            "abstract": "Purpose Given advances in digitalization and automation, manufacturing employees are facing the increasing threat of being substituted by smart machines and robots. The purpose of this paper is to propose a framework that explains as well as can be used to study career sustainability of workers in the fast-paced, continuously changing manufacturing landscape. Design/methodology/approach After tracing the evolution of manufacturing sector in China, the authors review existing literature on career sustainability and then propose a new framework. The authors then describe two fictive cases and illustrate the applicability of the four-dimensional framework in helping understand the lived experience of objects in these fictive cases. Findings The proposed dynamic framework of career sustainability constituted by four intricately interconnected dimensions (i.e. resourceful, flexible, renewable and integrative) is useful in understanding the fictive cases and hopefully will guide future research on career sustainability in manufacturing or similarly fast-past, dynamically changing environments. Practical implications The framework of career sustainability facilitates manufacturing employees to accurately evaluate the sustainability of their careers, whereby they can choose to continue, shift or re-orient their career paths during the transitional period toward digitalized manufacturing; it also enlightens employers to think about how to enhance the job security and engagement of workers by helping prolong their careers and re-design their career plans. Originality/value This paper proposes a novel yet context-specific framework to understand and study sustainability of careers. In addition to helping us understand how careers evolve during transformational periods, it also offers fruitful avenues for further research.",

            "abstract": "This book is the first practical, hands-on guide that shows how leaders can build psychological safety in their organizations, creating an environment where employees feel included, fully engaged, and encouraged to contribute their best efforts and ideas.Perhaps the leader’s most challenging task is to increase intellectual friction while decreasing social friction. When this doesn’t happen and it becomes emotionally expensive to say what you truly think and feel, that lack of psychological safety triggers the self-censoring instinct, shuts down learning, and blocks collaboration and creativity. Timothy R. Clark, a former CEO, Oxford-trained social scientist, and organizational consultant, provides a research-based framework to help leaders transform their organizations into sanctuaries of inclusion and incubators of innovation.When leaders cultivate psychological safety, teams and organizations progress through four successive stages. First, people feel included and accepted; then they feel safe to learn, contribute, and finally, challenge the status quo. Clark draws deeply on psychology, philosophy, social science, literature, and his own experiences to show how leaders can, and must, set the tone and model the ideal behaviors—as he says, “you either show the way or get in the way.” This thoughtful and pragmatic guide demonstrates that if you banish fear, install true performance-based accountability, and create a nurturing environment that allows people to be vulnerable as they learn and grow, they will perform beyond your expectations.",

            "abstract": "Management and organizational scholars have paid increasing attention to the interconnections between digital transformation and innovation management in the last decade. However, a highly fragmented understanding of this topic is what we are left with so far. In this editorial, we suggest an approach to open up the black box of the interplay between digital transformation and innovation management by providing a framework that identifies three levels of analyisis (i.e., macro, meso, and micro) along which existing and future research on the topic can be organized. This model encourages scholars to conduct theoretical and empirical studies on how digital transformation affects ecosystems’ structure and governance, how industries and firms compete and organize for innovation in a digitalized world, how the processes for developing new products and services change under the effect of digital technologies, and the implications of digital transformation on managing people and teams involved in the innovation process, among the other topics. We also provide a synthesis of the eight papers published in the Special Issue that this editorial introduces and develop an agenda for future research that will hopefully contribute to encourage and shape future scholarly efforts into this field.",

Dominique Vinck se propone analizar críticamente algunas de las ideas establecidas respecto a este revolucionario proceso cultural: el análisis de las humanidades digitales como nueva civilización y la «desmaterialización» del patrimonio cultural o cuantificación de las humanidades. Y es que la incorporación de la revolución digital puede suponer, según sostienen sus partidarios, el medio para salvar a las minusvaloradas humanidades, además de proporcionar una mayor democratización del saber, del acceso al patrimonio cultural, así como dialogo entre las culturas o como recurso para la innovación y el desarrollo económico. Pero las humanidades digitales también generan temores con respecto a lo que podríamos perder: ¿es posible que mueran el libro y las bibliotecas que conocemos? Afilados y sugerentes temas como éste, o como el robo del patrimonio cultural por parte de los países del norte a los del sur, la imposición de la hegemonía del inglés o la nueva brecha digital, se abordan en este libro, que recoge uno de los temas de mayor actualidad en nuestro panorama cultural del siglo XXI.",

En lugar de intentar definir la disciplina en términos absolutos, se ha optado por una aproximación diacrónica aunque se ha puesto el acento en algunos principios como la interdisciplinariedad y la construcción de modelos, valores como el acceso y el código abierto, y prácticas como la minería de datos y la colaboración.",

            "abstract": "Many historical processes are dynamic. Populations grow and decline. Empires expand and collapse. Religions spread and wither. Natural scientists have made great strides in understanding dynamical processes in the physical and biological worlds using a synthetic approach that combines mathematical modeling with statistical analyses. Taking up the problem of territorial dynamics–why some polities at certain times expand and at other times contract–this book shows that a similar research program can advance our understanding of dynamical processes in history. Peter Turchin develops hypotheses from a wide range of social, political, economic, and demographic factors: geopolitics, factors affecting collective solidarity, dynamics of ethnic assimilation/religious conversion, and the interaction between population dynamics and sociopolitical stability. He then translates these into a spectrum of mathematical models, investigates the dynamics predicted by the models, and contrasts model predictions with empirical patterns. Turchin’s highly instructive empirical tests demonstrate that certain models predict empirical patterns with a very high degree of accuracy. For instance, one model accounts for the recurrent waves of state breakdown in medieval and early modern Europe. And historical data confirm that ethno-nationalist solidarity produces an aggressively expansive state under certain conditions (such as in locations where imperial frontiers coincide with religious divides). The strength of Turchin’s results suggests that the synthetic approach he advocates can significantly improve our understanding of historical dynamics.",

            "abstract": "The start and end of the urban phase of the Indus civilization (IC; c. 2500 to 1900 BC) are often linked with climate change, specifically regarding trends in the intensity of summer and winter precipitation and its effect on the productivity of local food economies. The Indus Village is a modular agent-based model designed as a heuristic “sandbox” to investigate how IC farmers could cope with diverse and changing environments and how climate change could impact the local and regional food production levels required for maintaining urban centers. The complete model includes dedicated submodels about weather, topography, soil properties, crop dynamics, food storage and exchange, nutrition, demography, and farming decision-making. In this paper, however, we focus on presenting the parts required for generating crop dynamics, including the submodels involved (weather, soil water, land, and crop models) and how they are combined progressively to form two integrated models (land water and land crop models). Furthermore, we describe and discuss the results of six simulation experiments, which highlight the roles of seasonality, topography, and crop diversity in understanding the potential impact of environmental variability, including climate change, in IC food economies. We conclude by discussing a broader consideration of risk and risk mitigation strategies in ancient agriculture and potential implications to the sustainability of the IC urban centres.",

Using the results of experimental investigations at the Butser Ancient Farm Project it has been possible to derive a mathematical model for the effect of cultivation on assemblages of material in the ploughsoil. The model uses a probability density function to represent the effect of cultivation. Various implementations are described and the model has been applied to a number of material distributions, both artificial and real. The results of these studies illustrate the importance of cultivation-induced movement in the formation of archaeological assemblages in the ploughsoil.",

Thus, it is assumed that consciousness and the unconscious are not equal in natural mental processes. The human conscious is supposedly a “superstructure” above the unconscious automatic processes. Nevertheless, it is the unconscious that is the basis for the emotional and volitional manifestations of the human psyche and activity. At the same time, the alleged mental activity of Artificial Intelligence may be devoid of the evolutionary characteristics of the human mind. Several scenarios are proposed for the possible development of a “strong” AI through the prism of creation (or evolution) of the machine unconscious. In addition, we propose two opposite approaches regarding the relationship between the unconscious and the conscious.",

What underlies thinking and reasoning? One answer to these questions is that we rely on mental models of the world. Perception yields a mental model, linguistic comprehension yields a mental model, and thinking and reasoning are the internal manipulations of mental models. The germ of this answer was ﬁrst proposed during World War II by the remarkable Scottish psychologist and physiologist, Kenneth Craik. In a short but prescient book, The nature of explanation, he sketched such a theory. He wrote:If the organism carries a “small-scale model” of external reality and of its own possible actions within its head, it is able to try out various alternatives, conclude which is the best of them, react to future situations before they arise, utilize the knowledge of past events in dealing with the present and the future, and in every way to react in a much fuller, safer, and more competent manner to the emergencies which face it.",

            "abstract": "Mental Models offers nothing less than a unified theory of the major properties of mind: comprehension, inference, and consciousness. In spirited and graceful prose, Johnson-Laird argues that we apprehend the world by building inner mental replicas of the relations among objects and events that concern us. The mind is essentially a model-building device that can itself be modeled on a digital computer. This book provides both a blueprint for building such a model and numerous important illustrations of how to do it. In several key areas of cognition, Johnson-Laird shows how an explanation based on mental modeling is clearly superior to previous theory. For example, he argues compellingly that deductive reasoning does not take place by tacitly applying the rules of logic, but by mentally manipulating models of the states of affairs from which inferences are drawn. Similarly, linguistic comprehension is best understood not as a matter of applying inference rules to propositions derived from sentences, but rather as the mind’s effort to construct and update a model of the situation described by a text or a discourse. Most provocative, perhaps, is Johnson-Laird’s theory of consciousness: the mind’s necessarily incomplete model of itself allows only a partial control over the many unconscious and parallel processes of cognition. This an extraordinarily rich book, providing a coherent account of much recent experimental work in cognitive psychology, along with lucid explanations of relevant theory in linguistics, computer science, and philosophy Not since Miller, Galanter, and Pribram’s classic Plans and the Structure of Behavior has a book in cognitive science combined such sweep, style, and good sense. Like its distinguished predecessor, Mental Models may well serve to fix a point of view for a generation.",

            "abstract": "The discovery of a Roman mosaic from the 2nd century AD in Cantillana (Seville) generated interest and the need for exhaustive documentation, so that it could be recreated with real measurements in a 3D model, not only to obtain an exact replica, but with the intention of analyzing and studying the behavior of two main geomatics techniques. Thus, the objective of this study was the comparative analysis of both techniques: near object photogrammetry by SfM and terrestrial laser scanner or TLS. The aim of this comparison was to assess the use of both techniques in archaeological excavations. Special attention was paid to the accuracy and precision of measurements and models, especially in altimetry. Mosaics are frequently relocated from their original location to be exhibited in museums or for restoration work, after which they are returned to their original place. Therefore, the altimetric situation is of special relevance. To analyze the accuracy and errors of each technique, a total station was used to establish the real values of the ground control points (GCP) on which the comparisons of both methods were to be made. It can be concluded that the SfM technique was the most accurate and least limiting for use in semi-buried archaeological excavations. This manuscript opens new perspectives for the use of SfM-based photogrammetry in archaeological excavations.",

The aim of the paper is to show the application of the H-BIM method to a stone pavement road located in the Archaeological Site of Pompeii. In detail, starting from a laser scanner-based survey, juxtaposed with coordinated points georeferenced through a total station, point clouds were handled by means of several BIM-based tools to perform the road design process, starting from the digital elevation model (DEM) and proceeding to the corridor representation. Subsequently, a visual programming application based on Python language was adopted to update the corridor information by means of the object property set. As preliminary results, a tool, complete with graphical and non-graphical information, is proposed to be used in conservation, maintenance and restoration projects.",

Recent mathematical models applied to physics have included the idea that given phenomena cannot be predicted precisely although they can be predicted to some extent in line with the chaos theory Concepts such as deterministic models, sensitivity to initial conditions, strange attractors, and fractal dimensions are inherent to the development of this theory, A few situations involving normal or abnormal endogenous rhythms in biology have been analyzed following the principles of chaos theory This is particularly the case with cardiac arrhythmias, but less so with biological clocks and circadian rhythms.",

Even in the area in which I have some experience, that of the logics and structure of automata, my connections are almost entirely on one side, the mathematical side. The usefulness of what I am going to say, if any, will therefore be limited to this: I may be able to give you a picture of the mathematical approach to these problems, and to prepare you for the experiences that you will have when you come into closer contact with mathematicians. This should orient you as to the ideas and the attitudes which you may then expect to encounter. I hope to get your judgment of the modus procedendi and the distribution of emphases that I am going to use. I feel that I need instruction even in the limiting area between our fields more than you do, and I hope that I shall receive it from your criticisms.",

As far back as 1948 he introduced the idea of a theory of automata in a conference at the Hixon Symposium, September 1948 (von Neumann, 1951). From that time on, he worked to what he described himself not as a theory, but as “an imperfectly articulated and hardly formalized ”body of experience“ (introduction to ”The Computer and the Brain“, written around 1955-56 and published after his death (von Neumann, 1958)). He worked up to conceive the first cellular automaton (he is also said to have introduced the cellular epithet (Burks, 1972)). He also left interesting views about implied mathematics, including logics, probabilities, leading from the discrete to the continuous (von Neumann, 1951; von Neumann, 1956; von Neumann, 1966).",

This volume celebrates the 50th anniversary of its first formulation in Peter Berger and Luckmann’s classic foundational text, The Social Construction of Reality. Addressing the work’s contribution to establishing social constructivism as a paradigm and discussing its potential for current questions in social theory, the contributing authors indicate the various cultural understandings and theoretical formulations that exist of social construction, its different fields of research and the promising new directions for future research that it presents in its most recent developments. A study of the importance of a work that established a paradigm in the international sociology of knowledge, this book will appeal to scholars of sociology with interests in social theory, the history of the social sciences and the significance of social constructivism.",

Explanations sort themselves into several distinct types corresponding to patterns of causation, content domains, and explanatory stances, all of which have cognitive consequences. Although explanations are necessarily incomplete—often dramatically so in laypeople—those gaps are difficult to discern. Despite such gaps and the failure to recognize them fully, people do have skeletal explanatory senses, often implicit, of the causal structure of the world. They further leverage those skeletal understandings by knowing how to access additional explanatory knowledge in other minds and by being particularly adept at using situational support to build explanations on the fly in real time. Across development and cultures, there are differences in preferred explanatory schemes, but rarely are any kinds of schemes completely unavailable to a group.",

In the first part of the book issues of scientific method are explored. What are weasking when we pose scientific why? questions? How does probability play a role in answering such questions? What are scientific laws of nature? How can we understand what abstract theories are telling us about the world? What is the structure of the theories we use to explain the observablephenomena? Finally, how do theories evolve over time and what consequence do such changes have for our intuition that science is seeking the truth? In the second part of the volume, foundational issues are explored in a number of crucial physical theories. What do our best available theories tell us about space and time? When we apply quantum theory to fields or other systems with infinite degrees of freedom, what new foundational puzzlesappear and how might a theory of interpretation deal with them? Finally, what are the crucial foundational issues in statistical mechanics, where probabilities are applied to explain macroscopic thermal phenomena?",

            "abstract": "The aim of this article is to elucidate the notions of explanation and mechanism, in particular of the social kind. A mechanism is defined as what makes a concrete system tick, and it is argued that to propose an explanation proper is to exhibit a lawful mechanism. The so-called covering law model is shown to exhibit only the logical aspect of explanation: it just subsumes particulars under universals. A full or mechanismic explanation involves mechanismic law statements, not purely descriptive ones such as functional relations and rate equations. Many examples from the natural, biosocial, and social sciences are examined. In particular, macro-micro-micro-macro social relations are shown to explain other wise puzzling macro-macro links. The last part of the article relates the author’s progress, over half a century, toward understanding mechanism and explanation.",

            "abstract": "The past decade has seen tremendous growth and innovation in the use of digital resources, methods, and tools in the history of art and architecture. While digital art history is less developed than text-based disciplines, the emergence of new digital standards for visual and spatial data, and advances in computer vision are poised to revolutionize the field. This article provides a survey of recent developments in digital art history from the perspective of European and North American publications and conferences. I discuss the digitization of visual, spatial, and textual resources by museums, research centers, and individual researchers. Researchers have developed a variety of tools for digitally analyzing art and architecture, which can replicate or challenge traditional methods of formal, iconographic, and socio-historical analysis. Trends in published research indicate uneven growth in the theoretical sophistication of digital art history scholarship. While digital methods are quickly moving into the training of art history professionals and students, digital art history communities in museums, research institutes, and universities remain somewhat fragmented. I conclude with a reflection on critiques of digital art history, several of which have not been fully addressed in recent scholarship.",

            "abstract": "The domestication of plants and the origin of agricultural societies has been the focus of much theoretical discussion on why, how, when, and where these happened. The “when” and “where” have been substantially addressed by different branches of archaeology, thanks to advances in methodology and the broadening of the geographical and chronological scope of evidence. However, the “why” and “how” have lagged behind, holding on to relatively old models with limited explanatory power. Armed with the evidence now available, we can return to theory by revisiting the mechanisms allegedly involved, disentangling their connection to the diversity of trajectories, and identifying the weight and role of the parameters involved. We present the Human-Plant Coevolution (HPC) model, which represents the dynamics of coevolution between a human and a plant population. The model consists of an ecological positive feedback system (mutualism), which can be reinforced by positive evolutionary feedback (coevolution). The model formulation is the result of wiring together relatively simple simulation models of population ecology and evolution, through a computational implementation in R. The HPC model captures a variety of potential scenarios, though which conditions are linked to the degree and timing of population change and the intensity of selective pressures. Our results confirm that the possible trajectories leading to neolithisation are diverse and involve multiple factors. However, simulations also show how some of those factors are entangled, what are their effects on human and plant populations under different conditions, and what might be the main causes fostering agriculture and domestication.",

            "abstract": "Mobility plays a large role in generating the patterns of stone rawmaterial usage seen in forager archaeological sites, but how best to translate these patterns into a complete quantitative characterization of the organization of forager mobility remains a difficult problem. The number of potential variables involved, including rawmaterial quality and abundance as well as individual movement and technological decisions, makes it extremely difficult to analyze mobility independent of all other influences. This papers develops a formal model of forager mobility based on a wellknown stochastic process termed a Lvy random walk. When combined with neutral assumptions about how stone is procured and used, the model may be used to recover detailed quantitative information about the organization of forager mobility from rawmaterial transport distances. The model has clear behavioral interpretations in terms of levels of planning, risk sensitivity, and timeenergy optimization and thus provides several potential currencies for comparative studies of prehistoric mobility strategies. How other behavioral decisions such as rawmaterial selectivity and even social exchange of raw material might influence patterns of stone rawmaterial transport is also explored.",

            "abstract": "This paper creates and applies a computational model of irrigation agriculture in order to study the effects of salinization in Mesopotamia, with the model developed applicable to cases beyond that studied here. Scholars have long suspected that central and southern Mesopotamia present environments which limited agricultural production over the long-term. In regions such as central Mesopotamia, where salinization likely affected settlement and agriculture in different periods but was more manageable than in more southern regions, fallowing regimes, natural and engineered leaching, and decisions made on when to crop were strategies applied in order to limit the effects of salinization. In this paper, we assess the effectiveness of these coping strategies by incorporating projected climate, soil, and landscape conditions with agricultural practices. The simulation results not only demonstrate the effectiveness and limitations of inhibiting progressive salinization, but they can be compared with the archaeological record in order to determine if the results could reasonably be matched with past events and help to interpret settlement history.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we seek to build on existing mathematical studies of cultural change by exploring how the diversity of adaptive cultural traits evolves by innovation and cultural transmission when the payoff from adopting traits is both uncertain and frequency dependent. The model is particularly aimed at understanding the evolution of subsistence trait diversity, since the payoff from exploiting particular resources is often variable and subject to diminishing returns as a result of overexploitation. We find that traits that exploit the same shared resource evolve most quickly when intermediate rates of cultural transmission promote fluctuation in trait diversity. Higher rates of cultural transmission, which promote predominantly low diversity, and lower rates, which promote predominantly high diversity, both retard the adoption of traits offering higher payoff. We also find that the distribution of traits that exploit independent resources can evolve towards the theoretical Ideal Free Distribution so long as the rate of cultural transmission is low. Increasing the rate of cultural transmission reduces trait diversity, so that a more limited number of \"niches\" are occupied at any given time.",

Simulation can contribute important insights into the latter problem areas, however, the lack of consistent methodological discussion on data collection, model building and comparability of results still represents a significant gap in research, which we address in our work.",

            "abstract": "<p><strong class=\"journal-contentHeaderColor\">Abstract.</strong> The unprecedented use of Earth’s resources by humans, in combination with increasing natural variability in natural processes over the past century, is affecting the evolution of the Earth system. To better understand natural processes and their potential future trajectories requires improved integration with and quantification of human processes. Similarly, to mitigate risk and facilitate socio-economic development requires a better understanding of how the natural system (e.g. climate variability and change, extreme weather events, and processes affecting soil fertility) affects human processes. Our understanding of these interactions and feedback between human and natural systems has been formalized through a variety of modelling approaches. However, a common conceptual framework or set of guidelines to model human–natural-system feedbacks is lacking. The presented research lays out a conceptual framework that includes representing model coupling configuration in combination with the frequency of interaction and coordination of communication between coupled models. Four different approaches used to couple representations of the human and natural system are presented in relation to this framework, which vary in the processes represented and in the scale of their application. From the<span id=\"page896\"/> development and experience associated with the four models of coupled human–natural systems, the following eight lessons were identified that if taken into account by future coupled human–natural-systems model developments may increase their success: (1) leverage the power of sensitivity analysis with models, (2) remember modelling is an iterative process, (3) create a common language, (4) make code open-access, (5) ensure consistency, (6) reconcile spatio-temporal mismatch, (7) construct homogeneous units, and (8) incorporating feedback increases non-linearity and variability. Following a discussion of feedbacks, a way forward to expedite model coupling and increase the longevity and interoperability of models is given, which suggests the use of a wrapper container software, a standardized applications programming interface (API), the incorporation of standard names, the mitigation of sunk costs by creating interfaces to multiple coupling frameworks, and the adoption of reproducible workflow environments to wire the pieces together.</p>",

            "abstract": "Point 1: The ecological models of Alfred J. Lotka and Vito Volterra have had an enormous impact on ecology over the past century. Some of the earliest—and clearest—experimental tests of these models were famously conducted by Georgy Gause in the 1930s. Although well known, the data from these experiments are not widely available and are often difficult to analyze using standard statistical and computational tools. Point 2: Here, we introduce the gauseR package, a collection of tools for fitting Lotka-Volterra models to time series data of one or more species. The package includes several methods for parameter estimation and optimization, and includes 42 datasets from Gause’s species interaction experiments and related work. Additionally, we include with this paper a short blog post discussing the historical importance of these data and models, and an R vignette with a walk-through introducing the package methods. The package is available for download at github.com/adamtclark/gauseR. Point 3: To demonstrate the package, we apply it to several classic experimental studies from Gause, as well as two other well-known datasets on multi-trophic dynamics on Isle Royale, and in spatially structured mite populations. In almost all cases, models fit observations closely and fitted parameter values make ecological sense. Point 4: Taken together, we hope that the methods, data, and analyses that we present here provide a simple and user-friendly way to interact with complex ecological data. We are optimistic that these methods will be especially useful to students and educators who are studying ecological dynamics, as well as researchers who would like a fast tool for basic analyses.",

Here we demonstrate a method for mapping the boundaries, centers, and peripheries of ancient cultures, as well as the technological similarities between different cultures. The proposed workflow includes: a systematic collection of archaeological information in a database; a process to infer the similarities between assemblages and generate a network; and finally, a graphical method for big data visualization, a technique also used in social media analysis. We present the geography of multiple cultural complexes that span several stages of cultural evolution from the Lower to the Upper Paleolithic (Stone Age) and involve several species of the genus Homo. Finally, we discuss some alternative trajectories in which this workflow can be developed further.",

            "abstract": "The use of computers and complex software is pervasive in archaeology, yet their role in the analytical pipeline is rarely exposed for other researchers to inspect or reuse. This limits the progress of archaeology because researchers cannot easily reproduce each other’s work to verify or extend it. Four general principles of reproducible research that have emerged in other fields are presented. An archaeological case study is described that shows how each principle can be implemented using freely available software. The costs and benefits of implementing reproducible research are assessed. The primary benefit, of sharing data in particular, is increased impact via an increased number of citations. The primary cost is the additional time required to enhance reproducibility, although the exact amount is difficult to quantify.",

            "abstract": "Digital data play an increasingly important role in how we understand the present and the past. The challenges inherent in understanding and using digital data are as intellectually demanding as any other archaeological research endeavor. For these reasons, data management cannot be regarded as a simple compliance or technical issue. For data to be meaningfully preserved and used in intellectually rigorous ways, they need to be integrated fully into all aspects of archaeological practice, including ethics, teaching, and publishing. In this review, we highlight some of the significant and multifaceted challenges involved in managing data, including documentation, training, methodology, data modeling, trust, and ethical concerns. We then focus on the importance of building data literacy broadly among archaeologists so that we can manage and communicate the data our discipline creates. This involves more than learning to use a new tool or finding a data manager for one’s excavation or survey. Long-term, responsible stewardship of data requires understanding the workflows and human roles in data management. Putting effort now into thoughtful data management and broad data-literacy training means we will be able to make the most of the “bigger” data that archaeologists now produce. An important aspect of this reorientation will be to look beyond the boundaries of our own research projects and information systems. Future research, teaching, and public engagement needs will also compel us to explore how our data articulates with wider contexts—within and beyond our discipline.",

            "abstract": "How can archaeologists contribute to tracing the evolutionary dynamics of the coupled human-natural systems that characterize the Anthropocene? We present a Socio-Ecological Systems (SES) framework to integrate models of human and natural landscape formation processes in the mid to late Holocene on the Talgar alluvial fan on the north slope of the Tian Shan Mountains in the area known as “Semirech’ye” (“Seven Rivers”). We compare our model to the physical evidence from sediment profiles and the archaeological record of subsistence and settlement over the Holocene. The resulting coupled model situates “niche construction theory” and the idea of “transported landscapes” within the SES perspective to focus on how couplings and feedbacks between humans and biophysical processes create or limit opportunities for different modes of subsistence over time, especially during periods of expansion and colonization of new territories. In the Talgar region, we hypothesize that initial, low-level human manipulations of surface water flow across an alluvial fan coupled with aeolian and fluvial sediment dynamics in a series of positive feedbacks to increase the possibilities for agricultural production over time. The human niche in Talgar therefore became increasingly sedentary and agricultural in emphasis compared to niches constructed in other parts of Central Eurasia.",

Reproducibility is the practice of reanalysing data by taking the same steps and producing the same or similar results. Enabling reproducibility is an important step to ensure research quality and validate interpretations. There are currently many barriers to moving towards reproducible research such as the skill level of researchers in the practices, software and infrastructure needed to do reproducible research and concerns relating to opening up research such as how to share sensitive data.             In this article, we seek to introduce reproducible research in an understandable manner so that archaeologists can learn where and how to start improving the reproducibility of their research. We describe what reproducible archaeological research can look like and propose three different computational skill levels of reproducible workflows with examples. Finally, in an extensive appendix, we address common questions about reproducible research to remove the stigma about these issues and suggest ways to overcome them.

            "abstract": "Archaeology is often argued to provide a unique long-term perspective on humans that can be utilised for effective policy-making, for example, in discussions of resilience and sustainability. However, the specific archaeological evidence for resilient/sustainable systems is rarely explored, with these terms often used simply to describe a community that survived a particular shock. In this study, a set of 74 case studies of papers discussing archaeological evidence for resilience/sustainability are identified and analysed using bibliometric methods. Variables from the papers are also quantified to assess patterns and provide a review of current knowledge. A great variety of scales of analysis, case study locations, stressors, resilient/sustainable characteristics, and archaeological evidence types are present. Climate change was the most cited stressor (n = 40) and strategies relating to natural resources were common across case studies, especially subsistence adaptations (n = 35), other solutions to subsistence deficiencies (n = 23), and water management (n = 23). Resilient/sustainable characteristics were often in direct contrast to one-another, suggesting the combination of factors is more important than each factor taken individually.

            "abstract": "Research at the intersection of machine learning and the social sciences has provided critical new insights into social behavior. At the same time, a variety of issues have been identified with the machine learning models used to analyze social data. These issues range from technical problems with the data used and features constructed, to problematic modeling assumptions, to limited interpretability, to the models’ contributions to bias and inequality. Computational researchers have sought out technical solutions to these problems. The primary contribution of the present work is to argue that there is a limit to these technical solutions. At this limit, we must instead turn to social theory. We show how social theory can be used to answer basic methodological and interpretive questions that technical solutions cannot when building machine learning models, and when assessing, comparing, and using those models. In both cases, we draw on related existing critiques, provide examples of how social theory has already been used constructively in existing work, and discuss where other existing work may have benefited from the use of specific social theories. We believe this paper can act as a guide for computer and social scientists alike to navigate the substantive questions involved in applying the tools of machine learning to social data.",

This includes conceptual developments in ML motivated by physical insights, applications of machine learning techniques to several domains in physics, and cross fertilization between the two fields. After giving a basic notion of machine learning methods and principles, examples are described of how statistical physics is used to understand methods in ML. This review then describes applications of ML methods in particle physics and cosmology, quantum many-body physics, quantum computing, and chemical and material physics. Research and development into novel computing architectures aimed at accelerating ML are also highlighted. Each of the sections describe recent successes as well as domain-specific methodology and challenges.",

This article offers an overview of machine learning methods well-suited to social science problems, including decision trees, dimension reduction methods, nearest neighbor algorithms, support vector models, and penalized regression. In addition to novel algorithms, machine learning places great emphasis on model checking (through holdout samples and cross-validation) and model shrinkage (adjusting predictions toward the mean to reduce overfitting). This article advocates replacing typical regression analyses with two different sorts of models used in concert. A multi-algorithm ensemble approach should be used to determine the noise floor of a given dataset, while simpler methods such as penalized regression or decision trees should be used for theory building and hypothesis testing.",

            "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) has become increasingly influential to human society, yet the primary advancements and applications of ML are driven by research in only a few computational disciplines. Even applications that affect or analyze human behaviors and social structures are often developed with limited input from experts outside of computational fields. Social scientists—experts trained to examine and explain the complexity of human behavior and interactions in the world—have considerable expertise to contribute to the development of ML applications for human-generated data, and their analytic practices could benefit from more human-centered ML methods. Although a few researchers have highlighted some gaps between ML and social sciences [51, 57, 70], most discussions only focus on quantitative methods. Yet many social science disciplines rely heavily on qualitative methods to distill patterns that are challenging to discover through quantitative data. One common analysis method for qualitative data is qualitative coding. In this article, we highlight three challenges of applying ML to qualitative coding. Additionally, we utilize our experience of designing a visual analytics tool for collaborative qualitative coding to demonstrate the potential in using ML to support qualitative coding by shifting the focus to identifying ambiguity. We illustrate dimensions of ambiguity and discuss the relationship between disagreement and ambiguity. Finally, we propose three research directions to ground ML applications for social science as part of the progression toward human-centered machine learning.",

            "abstract": "Cultural change can be quantified by temporal changes in frequency of different cultural artefacts and it is a central question to identify what underlying cultural transmission processes could have caused the observed frequency changes. Observed changes, however, often describe the dynamics in samples of the population of artefacts, whereas transmission processes act on the whole population. Here we develop a modelling framework aimed at addressing this inference problem. To do so, we firstly generate population structures from which the observed sample could have been drawn randomly and then determine theoretical samples at a later time t2 produced under the assumption that changes in frequencies are caused by a specific transmission process. Thereby we also account for the potential effect of time-averaging processes in the generation of the observed sample. Subsequent statistical comparisons (e.g. using Bayesian inference) of the theoretical and observed samples at t2 can establish which processes could have produced the observed frequency data. In this way, we infer underlying transmission processes directly from available data without any equilibrium assumption. We apply this framework to a dataset describing pottery from settlements of some of the first farmers in Europe (the LBK culture) and conclude that the observed frequency dynamic of different types of decorated pottery is consistent with age-dependent selection, a preference for “young” pottery types which is potentially indicative of fashion trends.",

            "abstract": "A high degree of structuring is seen in the spatial distribution of symbolic artefact types associated with the Aurignacian culture in Upper Palaeolithic Europe, particularly the degree of sharing of ornament types across archaeological sites. Multivariate analyses of these distributions have been interpreted as indicating ethno-linguistic differentiation (Vanhaeren and d’Errico 2006), although simpler explanations such as isolation-by-distance have not been formally discounted. In this study we have developed a spatiotemporally explicit cultural transmission simulation model that generates expectations of a range of spatial statistics describing the distribution of shared ornament types. We compare these simulated spatial statistics to those observed from archaeological data for Aurignacian Europe—using Approximate Bayesian Computation—in order to test and compare a range of hypotheses concerning group interaction dynamics for the period. Among the set of hypotheses examined, we include ones where material culture does or does not drive group interaction dynamics.",

ABM allows the disaggregation of systems into individual components that can potentially have their own characteristics and rule sets. This is a powerful paradigm that can be exploited through simulation to further our knowledge of the workings of geographical systems. We present in this chapter an overview of ABM; the main features of an agent-based model are given, along with a discussion of what constitutes an agent-based model. The distinction between cellular automata (CA), microsimulation (MSM) and agent-based models are discussed along with the advantages and limitations of ABM for modelling geographical systems. We conclude with a brief discussion of important areas for further research.",

            "abstract": "Some of the most interesting questions one can ask about early societies, are about people and their relations, and the nature and scale of their organization. In this work, we attempt to answer such questions with approaches introduced by multiagent systems. Specifically, we developed a generic agent-based model (ABM) for simulating ancient societies. Unlike most existing ABMs used in archaeology, our model includes agents that are autonomous and utility-based. Our model can (and does) also incorporate different social organization paradigms and technologies used in ancient societies. Equipped with such paradigms, our model allows us to explore the transition from a simple to a more complex society by focusing on the historical social dynamics—i.e., the flexibility and evolution of power relationships depending on social context and time. As a case study, we employ our model to evaluate the impact of the implemented social and technological paradigms on an artificial Early Bronze Age “Minoan” society located at a particular region of the island of Crete. Model parameter choices are based on archaeological evidence and studies, but are not biased towards any specific assumption. Results over a number of different simulation scenarios demonstrate an impressive sustainability for settlements consisting of and adopting a socio-economic organization model based on self-organization, and which was inspired by a recent framework for modern self-organizing agent organizations. This is the first time a self-organization approach is incorporated in an archaeology ABM system.",

            "abstract": "This introductory essay aims to introduce the chapters in the book presenting some aspects of the theoretical and conceptual framework necessary to consider the advantages computer simulation techniques and technologies offer to historical disciplines, but also quoting from the hundreds of examples in current scientific literature to give a context within which the individual contributions can be understood better. We argue that historical simulations should be much more than vivid illustrations of what scholars believe in the present existed in the past. A simulation is basically the computer representation of a “mechanism”, representing how social intentions, goals and behaviors were causally connected in the past. This can be done by formulating a “generative model”, that is, a model of a set of mechanisms. In this chapter, it is suggested that computer simulation may act as a Virtual Laboratory to help studying how human societies have experimented relevant transformations and in which way the consequences of those transformations in technology, activities, behavior, organization or knowledge were transmitted to other social agents or groups of social agents. Building artificial societies inside a computer allows us to understand that social reality is not capricious. It has been produced somehow, although not always the same cause produces the same effect, because social actions are not performed in isolation, but in complex and dialectical frameworks, which favor, prevent, or modify the capacity, propensity, or tendency the action has to produce or to determine a concrete effect. This way of studying social dynamics in the past by means of computer simulations is beginning to abandon its infancy. Archaeologists and historians have started to convert social theories in computer programs trying to simulate social process and experiment with different explanations about known archaeological societies. Our book is just one additional example of a current trend among archaeologists and historians: historical events occurred only once and many years ago but within a computer surrogates of those events can be artificially repeated here and now for understanding how and why they happened.",

            "abstract": "Agent-based modelling (ABM) is an emerging archaeological tool that offers insights into processes which are archaeologically invisible or difficult to detect. Here we illustrate the potential of ABM for archaeomalacology, posing two research questions and comparing ABM results with Pacific archaeological sequences. The first analysis considers how molluscan energetic return rates (ERR) and age of reproductive maturity (ARM), singularly or in combination, influence prey population resilience. The second analysis assesses how prey spatial structure affects foraging efficiency and prey susceptibility to resource depression. Consistent with expectations from evolutionary ecology and life history theory, the ABM results demonstrate that both ERR and ARM influence prey population resilience (or vulnerability). However, the analysis also demonstrates that ARM is the more important variable and taxa with high ERR (i.e., large-bodied) are disproportionately affected by human harvesting. Not only are efficient foragers more likely to target high ERR taxa, but these prey often have delayed ARM and un-foraged individuals are more likely to be smaller and immature, with disadvantages for population stability and recovery. In short, early-maturing taxa are highly resilient, while late-maturing organisms are more vulnerable; these outcomes also are observed archaeologically. The ABM analyses also demonstrate the effects of prey spatial structure on molluscan susceptibility to resource depression. High prey aggregation initially allows for high foraging efficiency, but prey abundance and encounter rates often rapidly decline. In contrast, when prey are dispersed, search time is greater, leading to lower encounter rates and reduced foraging efficiency, but greater prey population stability. Our ABM and archaeological examples further illustrate that while general principles can be derived, the resilience and spatial structure of specific prey populations, as well as foraging outcomes, are context dependent and continuously evolving. Finally, we note that model departures from theoretical expectations serve to stimulate further research, including use of additional parameters, consideration of novel contextual evidence, and/or investigation of social, technological or environmental hypotheses.",

            "abstract": "Evidence for fire use becomes increasingly sparse the further back in time one looks. This is especially true for Palaeolithic assemblages. Primary evidence of fire use in the form of hearth features tends to give way to clusters or sparse scatters of more durable heated stone fragments. In the absence of intact fireplaces, these thermally altered lithic remains have been used as a proxy for discerning relative degrees of fire use between archaeological layers and deposits. While previous experimental studies have demonstrated the physical effects of heat on stony artefacts, the mechanisms influencing the proportion of fire proxy evidence within archaeological layers remain understudied. This fundamental study is the first to apply a computer-based model (fiReproxies) in an attempt to simulate and quantify the complex interplay of factors that ultimately determine when and in what proportions lithic artefacts are heated by (anthropogenic) fires. As an illustrative example, we apply our model to two hypothetical archaeological layers that reflect glacial and interglacial conditions during the late Middle Palaeolithic within a generic simulated cave site to demonstrate how different environmental, behavioural and depositional factors like site surface area, sedimentation rate, occupation frequency, and fire size and intensity can, independently or together, significantly influence the visibility of archaeological fire signals.",

            "abstract": "Archaeological and paleoecological studies demonstrate that human-caused fires have long-term influences on terrestrial and atmospheric systems, including the transformation of “wild” landscapes into managed, agricultural landscapes. Sedimentary charcoal accumulations alone provide only limited information about the influence of human-caused fires on long-term fire regimes. Computational modeling offers a new approach to anthropogenic fire that links social and biophysical processes in a “virtual laboratory” where long-term scenarios can be simulated and compared with empirical charcoal data. This paper presents CharRec, a computational model of landscape fire, charcoal dispersion, and deposition that simulates charcoal records formed by multiple natural and anthropogenic fire regimes. CharRec is applied to a case study in the Canal de Navarrés region in eastern Spain to reveal the role of human-driven fire regimes during the early and middle Holocene. A statistical comparison of simulated charcoal records and empirical charcoal data from the Canal de Navarrés indicates that anthropogenic burning, following the Neolithic transition to agro-pastoral subsistence, was a primary driver of fire activity during the middle Holocene.",

            "abstract": "The record of prehistoric crop cultivation in central Europe dates as far back as 5500 bc. In the pile-dwellings of the north-western pre-alpine forelands, dating roughly from 4300 to 800 bc, favourable taphonomic conditions provide evidence for the ways of cereal cultivation and consumption in unmatched detail. Based on different sets of (bio-) archaeological and palynological evidence, different hypotheses of crop husbandry methods have been developed for the wetland settlements. During the late Neolithic, two partly antithetic ideas are discussed: On one hand Shifting Cultivation assumes frequently shifted crop fields and the use of fire to provide nitrogen for plant uptake; On the other hand Permanent Cultivation reconstructs longer-ranging use of the fields, to which nitrogen may have been provided by various means. From the Bronze Age onwards, most probably some form of extensive ard cultivation was applied. In this article, we explore the implications of the different hypotheses for the socio-ecological system of the wetland sites. We combine the capability of agent-based modelling to simulate dynamic processes with the benefits provided by geographical information systems and the possibilities provided by the use of modern agro-ecosystem modelling tools. First, we used a mechanistic crop growth model, MONICA, to evaluate the influence of important factors of prehistoric crop yield formation: the climatic conditions, the soil texture and the degree of nitrogen availability. Second, we applied an agent-based model (WELASSIMO_crops) to simulate the spatial and economic implications related to the different crop husbandry methods. Our results provide quantitative information on the extent of crop husbandry activities in the wetland sites and on the effect of natural and anthropogenic factors on prehistoric crop yields. Without manure application, initial average yields of 1.0 t ha−1 a−1 are shown to decrease rapidly to only 50 % after 10 years. A manuring rate of 10 t ha−1 a−1 allows for higher yields of 1.7 t ha−1 a−1 and a slower rate of fertility decrease, but requires high numbers of livestock per capita. In shifting cultivation, high yields of 2.7 t ha−1 a−1 are reasonable, while necessitating a very large area and high labour input. Using the model results and a case study, we argue that permanent cultivation is more likely to have been the standard method, while burning of the landscape may have had different objectives than crop husbandry. We find that the combination of agent-based social and process-based biophysical modelling is a powerful tool to study the complex interdependencies in human-environment systems in the past.",

            "abstract": "The invention of projectile technology had important ramifications for hominin evolution. However, the number of stone points that could have been used as projectiles fluctuates in archaeological assemblages, making it difficult to define when projectile technology was first widely adopted and how its usage changed over time. Here we use an agent-based model to simulate a hunter-gatherer foraging system where armatures are dropped according to their usage. We explore the impact of interactions between human behaviors and the environmental constraints of a data-informed landscape on the distribution and number of lithic armatures found in archaeological assemblages. We ran 2400 simulations modeling different population sizes, rates of hunting with projectiles, and tool curation levels. For each simulation, we recorded the location of dropped armatures and calculated the number and percentage of used armatures that were discarded at habitation camps vs. lost during hunting. We used linear regression to identify the demographic, behavioral, and environmental factor(s) that best explained changes in these numbers and percentages. The model results show that in a well-controlled environment, most armatures used as projectile weapons are lost or discarded at hunting sites; only ∼4.5% of used armatures (or ∼2 armatures per year of simulation) are discarded in habitation camps where they would likely be excavated. These findings suggest that even rare hafted armatures found in the Early and Middle Stone Age could indicate a well-established use of such tools. Our model shows that interactions between reoccupation of archaeological sites, population size, rate of hunting with projectile weapons, and tool curation levels strongly influence the count of lithic armatures found in archaeological assemblages. Therefore, we argue that fluctuations in the counts of armatures documented at archaeological sites should be evaluated within their demographic and environmental contexts to better understand if they reflect spatiotemporal changes in hunting behavior.",

The purpose of this approach is to reconstruct the geographical expansion and subsequent dissolution of the LBK culture, and to gain insights into the reactiveness and resilience of this sociocultural system to climatic impacts. The socio-natural data are cross-analysed at multiple scales (from micro-regional to continental), via multi-agent modelling of the LBK farming system, based on ethno-archaeological inferences and integrating palaeoenvironmental and bioarchaeological disciplines, cultural archaeology, palaeodemography and economics.",

            "abstract": "Culturally transmitted behavior can be structured in its performance both geographically and temporally, in terms of where and when implements are made and used on the landscape (what Ingold calls “the taskscape”). Yet cultural transmission theory has not yet explored the consequences of behaviors transmitted differently due to their enactment at different taskscape locations, what Tostevin calls “taskscape visibility.” Here, we use computer simulations to explore how taskscape visibility and forager mobility affect the diversity of two selectively neutral culturally transmitted traits within a single population of social learners. The trait that can be transmitted from residential bases only (lower taskscape visibility) shows greater diversity than the trait that can be transmitted from residential bases and logistical camps (higher taskscape visibility). In addition, increased logistical mobility has a positive effect on the diversity of the trait with the lower taskscape visibility while it generally shows little to no effect on the diversity of the trait with higher taskscape visibility. Without an appreciation for the ways in which taskscape visibility and mobility can structure cultural transmission in space and through time, the difference in the observed equilibrium diversity levels of the two traits might be incorrectly interpreted as resulting from qualitatively different forms of biased cultural transmission. The results of our simulation experiment suggest that researchers may need to take the taskscape visibility into account when inferring cultural transmission from archaeological data.",

            "abstract": "This paper examines an alternative approach to previously proposed models of prehistoric exchange such as the law of monotonic decrement or the down-the-line exchange model developed by Renfrew (Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 34: 319–331, 1968, Renfrew 1977) to explain the distribution of obsidian across the Near East during the Neolithic period. Renfrew’s down-the-line model, which results in a very regular and clustered network, does not permit the circulation of obsidian to regions of the Near East that are further than 300 km from the source zones, as is shown in the archaeological data available. Obsidian exchange is a complex system where multiple factors interact and evolve in time and space. We therefore explore Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) so as to get a better understanding of complex networks. ABM simulations of an exchange network where some agents (villages) are allowed to attain long-distance exchange partners through correlated random walks are carried out. These simulations show what variables (population density, degree of collaboration between villages…) are relevant for the transfer of obsidian over long distances. Moreover, they show that a type of small-world exchange network could explain the breadth of obsidian distribution (up to 800 km from source) during the Near Eastern Neolithic.",

            "abstract": "Ancestral Pueblo farmers encountered the deep, well watered, and productive soils of the central Mesa Verde region of Southwest Colorado around A.D. 600, and within two centuries built some of the largest villages known up to that time in the U.S. Southwest. But one hundred years later, those villages were empty, and most people had gone. This cycle repeated itself from the mid-A.D. 1000s until 1280, when Puebloan farmers permanently abandoned the entire northern Southwest. Taking an interdisciplinary approach, this book examines how climate change, population size, interpersonal conflict, resource depression, and changing social organization contribute to explaining these dramatic shifts. Comparing the simulations from agent-based models with the precisely dated archaeological record from this area, this text will interest archaeologists working in the Southwest and in Neolithic societies around the world as well as anyone applying modeling techniques to understanding how human societies shape, and are shaped by the environments we inhabit.",

This study presents a first step towards a modular agent-based simulation that is based upon empirical data, as well as environmental suitability maps and an assessment of livestock units. To illustrate the capabilities of our simulation, we use a geographically explicit approach to simulate a component of the production of animal products of a rural settlement in the lower Bakırçay catchment, western Turkey. The model structurally couples various agent types representing several elements and processes of the animal husbandry and food production value chain, such as sedentary herders—practising daily, short-distance pastoralism—and their flocks of goats and sheep, as well as milking and slaughtering. The modelling tool captures the fundamental socio-ecological dynamics of animal husbandry and food production in rural settlements. Therefore, the tool is valuable as a basis to discuss hypotheses regarding the number of animals that are needed to cover the requirements of different growing populations.",

            "abstract": "In this chapter, a simulation model for better understanding the population dynamics of the limes zone is presented, building on our earlier study on the possible effects of recruitment of soldiers for the Roman army (Verhagen et al., Modelling the dynamics of demography in the Dutch limes zone. In: Multi-, inter- and transdisciplinary research in landscape archaeology. Proceedings of LAC 2014 Conference, Rome, 19–20 September 2014. Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam. https://doi.org/10.5463/lac.2014.62, 2016a). In this earlier study, a number of questions were raised concerning the realism of using estimates from historical demographical sources for understanding the population dynamics of the region. In the current paper, the available data sets, approaches and hypotheses regarding fertility and mortality in the Roman period are re-assessed, together with the available archaeological evidence on the population dynamics of the region. A revised model is then presented that allows for more refined experimenting with various demographic scenarios, showing that a much larger number of parameters can be responsible for changes in population growth than is often assumed in archaeological studies. In particular, marriage strategies would seem to play an important role in regulating the number of births. The model remains a work in progress that can be further refined and linked to models of settlement and land use development.",

            "abstract": "A consideration of ethnographic data, computational model results, and archaeological data suggest that changes in family-level economics coincident with subsistence intensification contributed to the emergence of social complexity among prehistoric hunter–gatherers in eastern North America by creating the conditions for a “rich get richer” scenario. Ethnographic data are used to construct a general computational model representing key person- and family-level behaviors, constraints, and decisions affecting the size and composition of hunter–gatherer families. Results from model experiments suggest that lowering the age at which children make a significant contribution to subsistence (e.g., through the broadening of the diet to include the kinds of mass-harvested, “low quality” foods that were increasingly exploited during the Archaic and Woodland periods) relaxes constraints on family size and makes large, polygynous families economically viable. Positive feedbacks between the productive and reproductive potentials of larger families produce right-tailed distributions of family size and “wealth” when the productive age of children is low and polygyny is incentivized. Size data from over 800 prehistoric residential structures suggest right-tailed distributions of family size were present during the Late Archaic through Middle Woodland periods. These distributions would have provided variability in family-based status that permitted the emergence of hereditary social distinctions.",

The introduction of this technique has potential benefits for the study of past conflicts. This paper presents an agent-based model (ABM) designed to help understand European military tactics during the eighteenth century, in particular during the War of the Spanish Succession. We use a computer simulation to evaluate the main variables that affect infantry performance in the battlefield, according to primary sources. The results show that the choice of a particular firing system was not as important as most historians state. In particular, it cannot be the only explanation for the superiority of Allied armies. The final discussion shows how ABM can be used to interpret historical data, and explores under which conditions the hypotheses generated from the study of primary accounts could be valid.",

            "abstract": "The role of centurions in Roman warfare has never been decisively established. Historical sources suggest that centurions exerted an influence on the performance of the Roman battle line that was highly disproportionate to their numbers, as well as to their particular actions. However, the lack of a formal framework of Roman tactics does not allow this proposition to be tested. The results obtained from an agent-based model (ABM) of Roman warfare, a computer-simulation technique, however, suggest that battle formations benefited greatly from the presence of even a small percentage of psychologically resilient soldiers, especially along the first line, even if these individuals displayed no more than average levels of skill and aggression. Hence, the model’s simulated patterns of Roman warfare indicate that the multiple roles performed by the centurions as described in the sources were not distinguished so much by tactics as by experience and imperviousness to the stress of combat.",

            "abstract": "In this paper, we report on the theoretical foundations, empirical context and technical implementation of an agent-based modeling (ABM) framework, that uses a high-performance computing (HPC) approach to investigate human population dynamics on a global scale, and on evolutionary time scales. The ABM-HPC framework provides an in silico testbed to explore how short-term/small-scale patterns of individual human behavior and long-term/large-scale patterns of environmental change act together to influence human dispersal, survival and extinction scenarios. These topics are currently at the center of the Neanderthal debate, i.e., the question why Neanderthals died out during the Late Pleistocene, while modern humans dispersed over the entire globe. To tackle this and similar questions, simulations typically adopt one of two opposing approaches, top-down (equation-based) and bottom-up (agent-based) models of population dynamics. We propose HPC technology as an essential computational tool to bridge the gap between these approaches. Using the numerical simulation of worldwide human dispersals as an example, we show that integrating different levels of model hierarchy into an ABM-HPC simulation framework provides new insights into emergent properties of the model, and into the potential and limitations of agent-based versus continuum models.",

Focusing primarily on the papers presented in this thematic issue, we review progress in spatial agent-based models along the lines of four methodological challenges: (1) design and parameterizing of agent decision models, (2) verification, validation and sensitivity analysis, (3) integration of socio-demographic, ecological, and biophysical models, and (4) spatial representation. Based on this we critically reflect on the future work that is required to make agent-based modeling widely accepted as a tool to support the real world policy.",

            "abstract": "Biological phenomena can be investigated at multiple levels, from the molecular to the cellular to the organismic to the ecological. In typical biology instruction, these levels have been segregated. Yet, it is by examining the connections between such levels that many phenomena in biology, and complex systems in general, are best explained. We describe a computation-based approach that enables students to investigate the connections between different biological levels. Using agent-based, embodied modeling tools, students model the microrules underlying a biological phenomenon and observe the resultant aggregate dynamics. We describe 2 cases in which this approach was used. In both cases, students framed hypotheses, constructed multiagent models that incorporate these hypotheses, and tested these by running their models and observing the outcomes. Contrasting these cases against traditionally used, classical equation-based approaches, we argue that the embodied modeling approach connects more directly to students’ experience, enables extended investigations as well as deeper understanding, and enables \"advanced\" topics to be productively introduced into the high school curriculum.",

            "abstract": "The use of agent-directed simulation in archaeology has a relatively long tradition. However, these simulations have been always oriented mainly to study spatial processes and resource management and systematically ignore an essential aspect of any society: the use of social and institutional norms as a mechanism to regulate the behaviour of the individuals. In this paper we propose a norm-centric simulation (in contrast to the traditional resource-centric simulation) where the normative system is both the core of the simulation and the subject of study. Ourfinal goal is to set the foundations of a rather general model of social behaviour in a hunter-fisher-gatherer (HFG) society without political institutions but with strict social norms.",

Such data opens up exciting new opportunities to work towards a quantitative understanding of our complex social systems, within the realms of a new discipline known as Computational Social Science. Against a background of financial crises, riots and international epidemics, the urgent need for a greater comprehension of the complexity of our interconnected global society and an ability to apply such insights in policy decisions is clear. This manifesto outlines the objectives of this new scientific direction, considering the challenges involved in it, and the extensive impact on science, technology and society that the success of this endeavour is likely to bring about.",

            "abstract": "Las Ciencias Sociales y las Humanidades presentan, especialmente estas últimas, dinámicas de investigación que las diferencian y las dotan de una personalidad propia, identificada como una cultura de investigación específica, diferente a la propia de las Ciencias Exactas y de la Vida. La existencia de una excesiva diferenciación entre esas culturas de investigación ha sido criticada de forma reiterada. No obstante, el rumbo fijado para la investigación por las políticas científicas asume la eliminación de esas posibles barreras y la fusión entre los diferentes campos del saber a través de la transferencia de los diferentes enfoques y metodologías. Así, se ha planteado la necesidad de una renovación de las Ciencias Humanas y Sociales, dirigida a matizar, por ejemplo, las dinámicas altamente individuales en la investigación humanística, la inexistencia de grandes grupos de investigación, el desarrollo de procesos de formalización de la información, la integración de metodologías cuantitativas y la integración en programas de investigación más amplios. El uso de las nuevas tecnologías y la implementación de procesos de digitalización ha llevado también a la emergencia de las Ciencias Sociales Computacionales y las Humanidades Digitales, que junto a otras nuevas áreas de conocimiento, como son por ejemplo las Humanidades Ambientales, constituyen la vanguardia en lo referido a las Humanidades y la transdisciplinariedad.",

The diverse digital methods and tools employed by archaeologists have led to a proliferation of innovative practice that has fundamentally reconfigured the discipline. Rather than reviewing specific technologies, this review situates digital archaeology within broader theoretical debates regarding craft and embodiment; materiality; the uncanny; and ethics, politics, and accessibility. A future digital archaeology must move beyond skeuomorphic submission and replication of previous structural inequalities to foment new archaeological imaginaries.",

With a thorough examination of the ways in which both everyday and cutting-edge technologies can be used to inform and enhance traditional methods, this book brings together ideology from the academic world and pragmatic, concrete examples to show how fieldwork, theory and technology fit together today as never before. Covering a history of the rise of computer use in archaeology as well as a thorough assessment of a number of high profile examples such as the Ferrybridge Chariot, this book shows how new technologies have been implemented into both theory and method as an integral part of the archaeological process. With contributions from renowned experts, experienced professionals and emerging names in the field, this unique, forward-thinking book brings together previously disparate aspects of archaeology in a new holistic approach to the study of the past. A companion website is also available to allow further study of the images included.",

Kathleen Fitzpatrick,¹ on the other hand, defines the “big tent” as “a nexus of fields within which scholars use computing technologies to investigate the kinds of questions that are traditional to the humanities, or, as is more true of [her] own work, who ask traditional",

            "abstract": "Extant theory suggests that candidates with an unfocused identity—those spanning different categories—suffer from a valuation penalty because evaluators are confused by their profile and concerned they lack the required skills. We argue that unfocused candidates may be penalized for another reason; they threaten established social boundaries. This happens in contexts where evaluators act as gatekeepers for social entities, such as professions. We test how the penalty applied to unfocused candidates varies in an academic accreditation process, a setting where evaluators decide on admitting candidates to an academic discipline and where candidates’ prior performance is observable. We find using data on the 2012 national scientific qualification in Italian academia that the valuation penalty applied to unfocused (multidisciplinary) candidates was most pronounced for the most high-performing candidates. High-performing yet ill-fitting candidates threaten the distinctiveness and knowledge domain of the discipline and are hence penalized by evaluators. High-performing multidisciplinary candidates suffered the greatest penalty in small and distinctive academic disciplines and when accreditors were highly typical members of their discipline. Our theory and findings suggest that the categorical imperative may be driven not only by cognitive or capability considerations as typically argued in the literature but also, by attempts to maintain social boundaries.",

            "abstract": "Modelling is an important aspect of many fields of research and study but can also be a rather complex and difficult undertaking. Archaeologists are generally much more comfortable defining models using verbal expressions rather than equations. There is an important distinction to make between forwards models, which start in mathematics and end with data, and inverse models, which begin with data and seek to find patterns within them suitable for further analysis. The sequence of events generated by such a model is termed a “Markov chain”. The modelling process begins with the often non-trivial step of recognizing that there is a problem worthy of study and amenable to analysis. Archaeology is difficult enough, dealing as it does with incomplete data sparsely sampled from heterogeneous landscapes. Models can provide indirect ways to measure parameters like population growth rate which, in turn, provides a metric for comparing different societies separated by space or time.",

As an application case study, we examine the mechanism of change in the composition of structural remains at the Jomon to Yayoi period sites in Western Japan. The simulations generate hypotheses that the major changes from the middle to the late Jomon periods and from the final Jomon period to the early Yayoi period may have been caused by different mechanisms. The latter could be interpreted as a continuous mechanism, such as inter-settlement exchanges, while the former could be interpreted as a non-continuous mechanism.",

            "abstract": "Computational modelling is increasingly gaining attention in archaeology and related disciplines. With the number of new models growing it is often difficult to evaluate their significance and the generality of the results. This is partially due to the narrow reporting of the model’s results, which are often limited to those directly relevant to the research question posed in the first place. Although this is not an issue per se, models, if explored exhaustively, can provide a much wider perspective on the studied system. Sensitivity analysis is a widely recognised model exploration method for assessing the importance of different parameters on the model’s behaviour. Such systematic exploration helps in unravelling the dynamics that drive the model and enable researchers to establish how robust the presented results are. Here we present a sensitivity analysis of MERCURY, a previously published archaeological agent-based model. The results show that two out of three of the original conclusions drawn on the basis of selective experiment design stand up to scrutiny. By describing in detail and providing a reusable script with detailed description of all steps of the sensitivity analysis we hope to promote this important model exploration technique among modellers and the wider archaeological audience.",

            "abstract": "Modern ecology recognizes that modelling systems across scales and at multiple levels—especially to link population and ecosystem dynamics to individual adaptive behaviour—is essential for making the science predictive. “Pattern-oriented modelling” (POM) is a strategy for doing just this. POM is the multi-criteria design, selection and calibration of models of complex systems. POM starts with identifying a set of patterns observed at multiple scales and levels that characterize a system with respect to the particular problem being modelled; a model from which the patterns emerge should contain the right mechanisms to address the problem. These patterns are then used to (i) determine what scales, entities, variables and processes the model needs, (ii) test and select submodels to represent key low-level processes such as adaptive behaviour, and (iii) find useful parameter values during calibration. Patterns are already often used in these ways, but a mini-review of applications of POM confirms that making the selection and use of patterns more explicit and rigorous can facilitate the development of models with the right level of complexity to understand ecological systems and predict their response to novel conditions.",

            "abstract": "This paper is a critical response to Andreas Bartels’ (2006) sophisticated defense of a structural account of scientiﬁc representation. We show that, contrary to Bartels’ claim, homomorphism fails to account for the phenomenon of misrepresentation. Bartels claims that homomorphism is adequate in two respects. First, it is conceptually adequate, in the sense that it shows how representation diﬀers from misrepresentation and non-representation. Second, if properly weakened, homomorphism is formally adequate to accommodate misrepresentation. We question both claims. First, we show that homomorphism is not the right condition to distinguish representation from misrepresentation and non-representation: a “representational mechanism” actually does all the work, and it is independent of homomorphism – as of any structural condition. Second, we test the claim of formal adequacy against three typical kinds of inaccurate representation in science which, by reference to a discussion of the notorious billiard ball model, we deﬁne as abstraction, pretence, and simulation. We ﬁrst point out that Bartels equivocates between homomorphism and the stronger condition of epimorphism, and that the weakened form of homomorphism that Bartels puts forward is not a morphism at all. After providing a formal setting for abstraction, pretence and simulation, we show that for each morphism there is at least one form of inaccurate representation which is not accommodated. We conclude that Bartels’ theory – while logically laying down the weakest structural requirements – is nonetheless formally inadequate in its own terms. This should shed serious doubts on the plausibility of any structural account of representation more generally.",

            "abstract": "The recent literature on “complex contagions” challenges Granovetter’s classic hypothesis on the strength of weak ties and argues that, when the actors’ choice requires reinforcement from several sources, it is the structure of strong ties that really matters to sustain rapid and wide diffusion. The paper contributes to this debate by reporting on a small-N study that relies on a unique combination of ethnographic data, social network analysis, and computational models. In particular, we investigate two rural populations of Indian and Kenyan potters who have to decide whether to adopt new, objectively more efficient and economically more attractive, technical/stylistic options. Qualitative field data show that religious sub-communities within the Indian and Kenyan populations exhibit markedly different diffusion rates and speed over the last thirty years. To account for these differences, we first analyze empirically observed kinship networks and advice networks, and, then, we recreate the actual aggregate diffusion curves through a series of empirically calibrated agent-based simulations. Combining the two methods, we show that, while single exposure through heterophilious weak ties were sufficient to initiate the diffusion process, large bridges made of strong ties can in fact lead to faster or slower diffusion depending on the type of signals circulating in the network. We conclude that, even in presence of “complex contagions,” dense local ties cannot be regarded as a sufficient condition for faster diffusion.",

            "abstract": "A new approach is suggested under the slogan “Keep it Descriptive Stupid” (KIDS) that encapsulates a trend in increasingly descriptive agent-based social simulation. The KIDS approach entails one starts with the simulation model that relates to the target phenomena in the most straight-forward way possible, taking into account the widest possible range of evidence, including anecdotal accounts and expert opinion. Simplification is only applied if and when the model and evidence justify this. This contrasts sharply with the KISS approach where one starts with the simplest possible model and only moves to a more complex one if forced to. An example multi-agent simulation of domestic water demand and social influence is described.",

            "abstract": "Insights into prehistoric region-wide political consolidation were suggested by simulation results from an agent-based model of pre-state societies. The case study was the late prehistoric period circa 2500 BC to AD 1000 in the Lake Titicaca basin of Peru and Bolivia. Over a series of simulation runs the model produced a range of alternative political pre-histories. A substantial proportion of those runs were classified as matching the scenario archeologists believe actually happened during this time period. Classification was based on multidimensional quantitative measures of empirical criteria for the emergence of simulated macro-level patterns corresponding to observed patterns in the archaeological record.The model’s structure consisted of a grid of cells, each scaled to 1.5 km x 1.5 km, representing the geography, hydrology, and agricultural potential of the 50,000 sq. km basin. A collection of multiple agents–Settlements, Peoples, Polities, and Chiefs (political leaders) – interacted with the environmental grid and with each other. The agents’ behavior was modeled as micro-level condition-action rules based on the hypothesized causal factors of: agriculture, migration, competition, and trade. Internal structure and dynamics as well as the simulation results showed strong indicators of the model’s structural realism. Uncertainties associated with the model were also assessed.",

            "abstract": "Least cost analysis (LCA) has emerged as a favored geospatial method used by archaeologists to model potential pathways of movement. To produce increasingly effective least cost models, we must more thoroughly consider the role that energetics have played throughout human history and understand how physiological conditions tied to energetics, such as fatigue, influence peoples’ decisions when moving. We illustrate this need by modeling a physically demanding case study from the American Southwest and demonstrate that the interpretive consequences of using time- versus energy-based cost function can have meaningful impacts on archaeological reconstructions of the past. Therefore, to better inform the selection of least cost functions in LCA, regardless of the material record in a specific study context, we present a theoretically informed strategy for classifying whether time or energy was a more pertinent cost to past movers by focusing on the role of fatigue and its influence on energetically efficient decision making.",

            "abstract": "We explore settlement structures and hierarchy found in different archaeological periods in northern, specifically the Khabur Triangle (KT), and southern Mesopotamia (SM) using a spatial interaction entropy maximization (SIEM) modeling and simulation method. Regional settlement patterns are investigated in order to understand what feedback levels for settlement benefits, or incentives, and abilities to move or disperse between sites in a landscape and period could have enabled observed settlement structures to emerge or be maintained. Archaeological and historical data are then used to interpret the best results. We suggest that in the Late Chalcolithic (LC) and first half of the Early Bronze Age (EBA), the KT and SM appear to have comparable urban patterns and development, where settlement advantage feedbacks and movement are similarly shaping the two regions for those periods. Within period variations, such as restrictions to population diffusion or movement in the EBA, are possible. In the KT during the Middle Bronze Age (MBA), multiple centers begin to emerge, suggesting a lack of social cohesion and/or political fragmentation. This is similar to SM in the MBA, but we also see the emergence of a single, dominant site. In the Iron Age (IA), movement in the KT likely becomes the least constrained in all assessed periods, as socio-political cohesion facilitates this process, with small sites now the norm and dominance by one state over the region is evident. For the same period in SM, a single site (Babylon) obtains significant settlement advantages relative to its neighbors and easy movement enables it to become far larger in size and likely socially, economically, and politically dominant. Overall, the results demonstrate that the method is useful for archaeologists and social theorists in allowing them to compare different archaeological survey results, with varied spatial dimensions and diachronically, while providing a level of explanation that addresses empirical settlement patterns observed.",

            "abstract": "Herding and farming coexisted in Central Asia for several thousand years as main options of preindustrial economic production. The relationship between people practicing different variants of these modes of subsistence is known to have been dynamic. Among the many possible explanations, we explore this dynamic by modeling mechanisms that connect aggregate decisions to land use patterns. Within the framework of the SimulPast project, we show here the results from step 1 of our modeling program: the Musical Chairs Model. This abstract agent-based model describes a mechanism of competition for land use between farming and herding. The aim is the exploration of how mobility, intensity, and interdependence of activities can influence land use pattern. After performing a set of experiments within the framework of this model, we compare the implications of each condition for the corroboration of specific land use patterns. Some historical and archaeological implications are also discussed. We suggest that the overall extension of farming in oases can be explained by the competition for land use between farming and herding, assuming that it develops with little or no interference of climatic, geographical, and historical contingencies.",

            "abstract": "The development, floruit and decline of the urban phase of the Indus Civilisation (c.2600/2500-1900 BC) provide an ideal opportunity to investigate social resilience and transformation in relation to a variable climate. The Indus Civilisation extended over most of the Indus River Basin, which includes a mix of diverse environments conditioned, among other factors, by partially overlapping patterns of winter and summer precipitation. These patterns likely changed towards the end of the urban phase (4.2 ka BP event), increasing aridity. The impact of this change appears to have varied at different cities and between urban and rural contexts. We present a simulation approach using agent-based modelling to address the potential diversity of agricultural strategies adopted by Indus settlements in different socio-ecological scenarios in Haryana, NW India. This is an ongoing initiative that consists of creating a modular model, Indus Village, that assesses the implications of trends in cropping strategies for the sustainability of settlements and the resilience of such strategies under different regimes of precipitation. The model aims to simulate rural settlements structured into farming households, with sub-models representing weather and land systems, food economy, demography, and land use. This model building is being carried out as part of the multi-disciplinary TwoRains project. It brings together research on material culture, settlement distribution, food production and consumption, vegetation and paleoenvironmental conditions.",

            "abstract": "There is a long-standing view that, in the Roman world, transport by sea and river was very much cheaper than by land. Previous analyses of transport costs have relied primarily on a few surviving historical records, notably the Edict on Maximum Prices issued by Diocletian in 301 CE. Here we outline an alternative method for deriving relative costs of transportation by different modes using materials recovered in archaeological excavations. We apply this to the distribution of Late Romano-British pottery (c. 250–400 CE) to calculate the cost ratios of transportation by road, river and sea to rural settlements and towns in lowland Britannia. The analysis suggests a best fit cost ratio of road to rivers and sea of 1:3:4 (i.e. transport by road was three times as costly as by river and four times that by sea), with 95% confidence interval of roads to rivers 1:1–5 and roads to sea of 1:1–9. These values are broadly consistent with transport cost ratios of 1:4:8 in England in the first half of the fourteenth century, when the country’s transport network had reached a degree of integration comparable with late Roman Britain.",

            "abstract": "The 15th–18th century CE site of Engaruka in Tanzania is often described as primarily comprising drystone agricultural terraces, but it is now known that many of these former farming plots are not terraces per se, but are instead sediment traps. Stratigraphic excavations of these traps show that they were built by constructing low drystone walls adjacent to either natural or artificial water courses in order to capture fine alluvial sediments entrained within water flows. In the northern area of the site sediments were accumulated to a depth of up to 700 mm, while in one area in the south of the site over 2 m of deposits were accumulated over at least a 300 year period. The presence of sediment traps on archaeological sites allows investigations of the efficacy and sustainability of these structures over decadal to centennial timescales, since stratigraphic excavations can define the process of construction, and geoarchaeological analyses can explore changes within accumulated sediments over time. Although a combination of stratigraphy and absolute dating can discern the broad sequence and timing of sediment capture they cannot determine sediment-accumulation rates, and these techniques are too time consuming to be used to map the development of over 9 km2 of sediment traps. The ESTTraP agent-based model provides these data by simulating sediment accumulation under different hydrological conditions. Four scenarios were simulated for a period of 100 years: constant water availability (SIM-01), seasonal variability (SIM-02), long-term climate variability (SIM- 03), and vegetation-cover impact (SIM-04). The model results suggest that the fields can be constructed over a short period of time, approximately 1–3 months per 6 × 6 m field, and that to construct a block of 90 fields covering 3,000 m2 it would take between 8 and 13 years in periods of high water availability, and up to 27 years during prolonged dry periods. The results define the amount of time needed to construct individual fields, and suggest that farmers constructed blocks of fields concurrently rather than sequentially expanding across the landscape, and that the c. 10 km2 area of sediment traps at Engaruka could have been constructed by a number of households working independently. The ESTTraP model presents an important resource in the assessment of sediment dynamics and patterns of field development, is relevant to a range of archaeological sites worldwide that include intentional or unintentional alluvial deposition, and has applications for modern landscape management.",

All files are released under GNU General Public License v3.0.The Indus Village model is an agent-based model aiming to represent one or more rural settlements of the Indus Civilisation. The population is structured in households that engage in crop-based agriculture for food production and other complementary activities, having available several possible cropping configurations for adapting to local environmental conditions and coping with climate-driven changes. The model contains multiple submodels that are being designed and implemented separately and are made available to facilitate re-use. The model is under development, but several submodels have been designed and implemented in NetLogo (v6.0.4).For details on the model general structure and submodels, consult the repository wiki at: https://github.com/Two-Rains/indus-village-model/wikiThe content of this repository was made possible thanks to funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement no 648609) for the TwoRains project (https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/two-rains).

            "abstract": "Despite tendencies toward convergence, differences between individuals and groups continue to exist in beliefs, attitudes, and behavior. An agent-based adaptive model reveals the effects of a mechanism of convergent social influence. The actors are placed at fixed sites. The basic premise is that the more similar an actor is to a neighbor, the more likely that that actor will adopt one of the neighbor’s traits. Unlike previous models of social influence or cultural change that treat features one at a time, the proposed model takes into account the interaction between different features. The model illustrates how local convergence can generate global polarization. Simulations show that the number of stable homogeneous regions decreases with the number of features, increases with the number of alternative traits per feature, decreases with the range of interaction, and (most surprisingly) decreases when the geographic territory grows beyond a certain size.",

            "abstract": "This article focuses on hunter-gatherer impact on interglacial vegetation in Europe, using a case study from the Early Holocene (9200–8700 BP). We present a novel agent-based model, hereafter referred to as HUMLAND (HUMan impact on LANDscapes), specifically developed to define key factors in continental-level vegetation changes via assessment of differences between pollen-based reconstruction and dynamic global vegetation model output (climate-based vegetation cover). The identified significant difference between these two datasets can be partially explained by the difference in the models themselves, but also by the fact that climate is not the sole factor responsible for vegetation change. Sensitivity analysis of HUMLAND showed that the intensity of anthropogenic vegetation modification mainly depended on three factors: the number of groups present, their preferences for vegetation openness around campsites, and the size of an area impacted by humans. Overall, both climate and human activities had strong impacts on vegetation openness during the study period. Our modelling results support the hypothesis that European ecosystems were strongly shaped by human activities already in the Mesolithic.",

            "abstract": "The field of cultural evolution has emerged in the last few decades as a thriving, interdisciplinary effort to understand cultural change and cultural diversity within an evolutionary framework and using evolutionary tools, concepts and methods. Given its roots in evolutionary biology, much of cultural evolution is grounded in, or inspired by, formal models. Yet many researchers interested in cultural evolution come from backgrounds that lack training in formal models, such as psychology, anthropology or archaeology. The aim of this book is to partly address this gap by showing readers how to create individual-based models (IBMs, also known as agent-based models, or ABMs) of cultural evolution. We provide example code written in the programming language R, which has been widely adopted in the scientific community. We will go from very simple models of the basic processes of cultural evolution, such as biased transmission and cultural mutation, to more advanced topics such as the evolution of social learning, demographic effects, and social network analysis. Where possible we recreate existing models in the literature, so that readers can better understand those existing models, and perhaps even extend them to address questions of their own interest.",

The questions related to the efficient, systematic and error-proof exploration of parameter spaces are of great importance to better understand, estimate confidences and make use of the output from these models. In this work, we investigate some of the relevant questions related to parameter space exploration, in particular using the technique known as Latin Hypercube Sampling and focusing in quantitative output analysis. We present the analysis of a structured population growth model and contrast our findings with results from previously used techniques, known as sensitivity and elasticity analyses. We also assess how are the questions related to parameter space analysis being currently addressed in the ecological literature.",

            "abstract": "Computational and mathematical models in biology rely heavily on the parameters that characterize them. However, robust estimates for their values are typically elusive and thus a large parameter space becomes necessary for model study, particularly to make translationally impactful predictions. Sampling schemes exploring parameter spaces for models are used for a variety of purposes in systems biology, including model calibration and sensitivity analysis. Typically, random sampling is used; however, when models have a high number of unknown parameters or the models are highly complex, computational cost becomes an important factor. This issue can be reduced through the use of efficient sampling schemes such as Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and Sobol sequences. In this work, we compare and contrast three sampling schemes – random sampling, LHS, and Sobol sequences – for the purposes of performing both parameter sensitivity analysis and model calibration. In addition, we apply these analyses to different types of computational and mathematical models of varying complexity: a simple ODE model, a complex ODE model, and an agent-based model. In general, the sampling scheme had little effect when used for calibration efforts, but when applied to sensitivity analyses, Sobol sequences exhibited faster convergence. While the observed benefit to convergence is relatively small, Sobol sequences are computationally less expensive to compute than LHS samples and also have the benefit of being deterministic, which allows for better reproducibility of results.",

The Weather model generates synthetic weather time series (solar radiation, temperature, precipitation) using algorithms based on sinusoidal and double logistic functions, incorporating stochastic variation to mimic unpredictable weather patterns. It aims to provide realistic yet flexible weather inputs for exploring diverse climate scenarios. The model is implemented in NetLogo and R, offering a computationally efficient method to generate extensive weather data for socioecological simulations. We further discuss the caveats and advantages of the procedural approach over data-driven or mechanistic methods for simulating past climates in complex systems. The Weather model was designed as a component of the Indus Village model, which is a larger simulation framework studying the Indus Civilisation, but it can be used independently.",
