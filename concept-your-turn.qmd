# Your turn! {#concept-your-turn}

To have your own experience in conceptual modelling for simulation, you will need:

- Pen and paper or your preferred sketching digital platform (tablet, laptop).

- A subject of interest in archaeology, preferably one that you know or have thought about in terms of explanations. Alternatively, you can select a model that has been explained verbally, but never formalised; for example, a written description of an explanation in a paper or book chapter. Remember, explanation means here that evidence is associated to a phenomenon, a process, and a mechanism (causal relationships).

You may work in groups, as long as everyone is actually interested on the chosen topic.

Choose well, and you may continue developing it in the implementation step!
