# Your turn! {#concept-your-turn}

To have your own experience in conceptual modelling for simulation, you will need:

- Pen and paper or your preferred sketching digital platform (tablet, laptop).

- A subject of interest in archaeology, preferably one that you know or have thought about in terms of explanations. Alternatively, you can select a model that has been explained verbally, but never formalised; for example, a written description of an explanation in a paper or book chapter. Remember, explanation here means that evidence is associated with a phenomenon, a process, and a mechanism (i.e., causal relationships).

You may work in groups, as long as everyone is actually interested in the chosen topic.

Choose wisely, and you can continue to develop it in the implementation step.
