# Introduction to NetLogo {#netlogo-intro}

## Preparation

To prepare for the sessions of Tuesday to Friday, you need to:

- Download or 'clone' the contents of [this repository](https://github.com/CoDArchLab-ABM/course-guide/) into a local folder. Select ![Code](assets/images/Code-button.png) in the top right of the repository page in GitHub, and choose one of the options given.

- Download and install NetLogo version 6.4.0. The operating system-specific installation files are found here: https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml

## Excursion to ABMA

Before even opening NetLogo in your computer, let us take advantage of the materials available at the Agent-Based Modeling for Archaeologists (ABMA) portal. These were created as a Erasmus+ project by a group of esteemed colleagues, with the goal of further the education on the use of simulation and agent-based modelling in archaeology.

Visit ["Tutorials"](https://abmarchaeologists.github.io/ABMA_website/#/about-tutorial) and then "Open Tutorials". You will access a interactive web application presenting a few basic concepts of simulation and agent-based modelling, as well as familiarise you with NetLogo's interface. The latter is done with NetLogo Web, but it broadly corresponds to what you will see when opening a local installation in your computer. 

Please perform all four lessons (approx. 30 min).
