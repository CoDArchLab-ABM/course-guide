# Calculating water flow accumulation {#messara-water-flow}

## Water flow algorithm

Towards our calculation of land productivity, we advance using our GIS data in combination with parts of the Land submodel in the [Indus Village model](https://github.com/Andros-Spica/indus-village-model) (Angourakis 2021). Our objective in this step is to reach a flow accumulation value for each patch according to their relative elevation within the terrain. This will serve as a proxy of the region hydrology beyond the data we have on rivers.

The submodel is based on the algorithm described in Jenson & Domingue (1988) through the implementation used by Huang & Lee (2015).

## Adding the main procedures

The algorithm uses a numeric codification of the eight neighbour directions and a tag that classifies patches as "start", "pending", "done", progressively converting the formers into the latter. Patches on the edge of the map are directed automatically towards the outside. Because this is an significant piece of code based on a specific reference, we will enclose all related procedures within a especial commentary note:

Outside this enclosed section, we add the two main procedures `set-flow-directions` and `set-flow-accumulations` inside a higher level `setup-flows`:

```NetLogo
to setup-flows

  fill-sinks
  
  set-flow-directions

  set-flow-accumulations

  ; set maximum flow accumulation as a reference
  set maxFlowAccumulation max [flow_accumulation] of patchesWithElevationData

end
```

We add a last step to get `maxFlowAccumulation`, which we will need for scaling purposes.

## Visualisation

As usual, we need to implement some extra code to be able to visualise the outcome. In this case, however, we would like to observe simultaneously flow direction, flow accumulation *and* elevation. For this, we will use an accessory agent type whose only function is representing the flow of patches on top of its colour.

```NetLogo
breed [ flowHolders flowHolder ]

...

to display-flows

  if (not any? flowHolders)
  [
    ask patchesWithElevationData [ sprout-flowHolders 1 [ set hidden? true ] ]
  ]

  ifelse (show-flows)
  [
    ask patchesWithElevationData
    [
      let flow_directionHere flow_direction
      let nextPatchInFlow get-patch-in-flow-direction flow_direction
      if (not [((elevation <= 0) or (elevation >= 0))] of nextPatchInFlow) [ set nextPatchInFlow nobody ]
      let flow_accumulationHere flow_accumulation

      ask one-of flowHolders-here
      [
        ifelse (nextPatchInFlow != nobody)
        [
          if (link-with one-of [flowHolders-here] of nextPatchInFlow = nobody)
          [ create-link-with one-of [flowHolders-here] of nextPatchInFlow ]

          ask link-with one-of [flowHolders-here] of nextPatchInFlow
          [
            set hidden? false
            let multiplier 1E100 ^ (1 - flow_accumulationHere / (max [flow_accumulation] of patchesWithElevationData)) / 1E100
            set color 92 + (5 * multiplier)
            set thickness 0.4 * ( 1 - ((color - 92) / 5))
          ]
        ]
        [
          set hidden? false
          let multiplier 1E100 ^ (1 - flow_accumulationHere / (max [flow_accumulation] of patchesWithElevationData)) / 1E100
          set color 92 + (5 * multiplier)
          if (color <= 97) [ set shape "line half" ]
          if (color < 95) [ set shape "line half 1" ]
          if (color < 93) [ set shape "line half 2" ]
          set heading get-angle-in-flow-direction flow_direction
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
  [
    ask flowHolders
    [
      set hidden? true
      ask my-links [ set hidden? true ]
    ]
  ]

end

to-report get-angle-in-flow-direction [ neighborEncoding ]

  ; 64 128 1
  ; 32  x  2
  ; 16  8  4

  if (neighborEncoding = 16) [ report 225 ]
  if (neighborEncoding = 32) [ report 270 ]
  if (neighborEncoding = 64) [ report 315 ]

  if (neighborEncoding = 8) [ report 180 ]
  if (neighborEncoding = 128) [ report 0 ]

  if (neighborEncoding = 4) [ report 135 ]
  if (neighborEncoding = 2) [ report 90 ]
  if (neighborEncoding = 1) [ report 45 ]

  report nobody

end
```

Now, press "setup". The calculation of variables is made relatively fast, but displaying all flowHolders will take some time.

## Assessing fit

To better visualise how much `flow_accumulation` actually gets accumulated, let us run the following "highlight" command directly in the console:

```NetLogo
ask patches with [flow_accumulation > 10] [ set pcolor red ]
```

![Highlight of patches with flow accumulation greater than 10](assets/screenshots/BlockC_module2_flows-accumulation-more-than-10.png)

Our approximation of the region's hydrological system is definitely not perfect. As a minimum, we want the main river, Lithaíos, to emerge, even if following an approximated path. The problem is most likely generated by our previous step: reducing the resolution of the original DEM. The height map we are using has many "sinks" in it (*i.e.*, patches not at the edge with the lowest elevation among its neighbours).

Worse, it might be that the roughness of the terrain escapes even the lowest of the resolutions treatable at this scale, to a point where the pathways of rivers cannot be retraced using height maps. Let us work with the first hypothesis and address the sinks in our processed height map.

## Improving fit with `fill-sink`

Our result could be improved by using the `fill-sink` procedure in the original Land model implementation (see code in the [Indus Village repository](https://github.com/Andros-Spica/indus-village-model/tree/master/03-land-model)), which is based on Huang & Lee (2015).

This procedure fills up the elevation of "sink" patches so flow can continue moving, until it reaches the edge of the map.

First, we can identify sink patches with the following procedure:

```NetLogo
to-report is-sink ; ego = patch

  let thisPatch self

  report (not is-at-edge) and (elevation <= min [elevation] of neighbors with [((elevation <= 0) or (elevation >= 0))])

end
```

We then used it together with our previous "highlight" command in the console:

```NetLogo
ask patches with [is-sink] [ set pcolor red ]
```

![Highlight of sink patches](assets/screenshots/BlockC_module2_flows-sinks.png)  
*Highlight of sink patches*

We then implement the `fill-sinks` algorithm:

```Netlogo
to fill-sinks

  while [ count patchesWithElevationData with [is-sink] > 0 ]
  [
    ask patchesWithElevationData with [is-sink]
    [
      set elevation [elevation] of min-one-of neighbors [elevation] + 1E-1
    ]
  ]

end
```

After running `setup` again, we obtain a much better result. We can now clearly identify what should be the Lithaíos river and its path is not too far from our original river data.

*View of flow direction and accumulation, calculated with 'flows' module with the `fill-sinks` procedure*

*Highlight of patches with flow accumulation greater than 10, after we include the `fill-sinks` procedure*

We should remember that this algorithm modifies our original DEM heightmap and costs more computation resources/time.

## Implementing a feature to export and import `world`

We do not want to repeat this every time we initialise a simulation run. Therefore, we will export the entire map configuration to a file for later use. We do this quickly with "File > Export... > Export World" and selecting the data folder. We could write procedures specific for exporting (and importing) a subset of data. Still, this option is much faster, given that this is the initial spatial data we want for all further versions.

Still, if you need to do this several times and want to keep track of the directory and file you are using, you can add a button to the interface with the following code, which is equivalent to the built-in option in the menu:

```Netlogo
export-world "data/terrainWithFlows/BlockC_module2_flows world.csv"
```

The same can be done to import the same file. Inside a new button, add:

```Netlogo
clear-all
import-world "data/terrainWithFlows/BlockC_module2_flows world.csv"
```

Now, you should be able to export and import your map with flows.

See the fully implemented version of this module: `BlockC_module2_flows.nlogo`.

For the sake of this example, we will assume our approximation to be sufficient. Still, tackling this kind of problem exploring other solutions in your own time could be an excellent exercise for improving your skills.
